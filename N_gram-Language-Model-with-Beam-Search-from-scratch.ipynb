              "'PM denies knowledge of AWB kickbacks\\nThe Prime Minister has denied he knew AWB was paying kickbacks to Iraq despite writing to the wheat exporter asking to be kept fully informed on Iraq wheat sales.\\nLetters from John Howard and Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile to AWB have been released by the Cole inquiry into the oil for food program.\\nIn one of the letters Mr Howard asks AWB managing director Andrew Lindberg to remain in close contact with the Government on Iraq wheat sales.\\nThe Opposition\\'s Gavan O\\'Connor says the letter was sent in 2002, the same time AWB was paying kickbacks to Iraq though a Jordanian trucking company.\\nHe says the Government can longer wipe its hands of the illicit payments, which totalled $290 million.\\n\"The responsibility for this must lay may squarely at the feet of Coalition ministers in trade, agriculture and the Prime Minister,\" he said.\\nBut the Prime Minister says letters show he was inquiring about the future of wheat sales in Iraq and do not prove the Government knew of the payments.\\n\"It would have been astonishing in 2002 if as Prime Minister I hadn\\'t done anything I possibly could to preserve Australia\\'s very valuable wheat market,\" he said.\\n\\nEmail questions\\nToday at the inquiry, AWB trading manager Peter Geary has been questioned about an email he received in May 2000.\\nIt indicated that the Iraqi Grains Board had approached AWB to provide \"after-sales service\".\\nMr Geary said he had forwarded the email to two AWB colleagues and did not remember reading it, although he said he may have skimmed it.\\n\\nSupport\\nAWB still has plenty of support among grain growers in central western New South Wales despite the revelations of the Cole inquiry.\\nProducers say they broadly support AWB\\'s attempts to get the best prices for their products.\\n\"I think it\\'s all a ploy by overseas interests to try and get the single desk put aside. The stories that are going round about the commission and everything, I think that\\'s the way people have got to do things to do business with the Middle East and Asian countries,\" one producer said.\\n\"I think it\\'s actually a pretty reasonable system and I think actually I\\'d give them pretty fair support at the moment. I think on average they\\'ve performed fairly well,\" another producer said.\\n\"The biggest thing about someone else taking over is whether the multinationals will get too much of a foothold in there and take it too much to their advantage.\"\\n\\nGrain prices\\nBut an analyst predicts grain prices will drop another $20 a tonne on the back of the inquiry into AWB.\\nMalcolm Bartholomaeus says pool returns have already dropped by $20 a tonne this year from the average price over the past five years.\\nHe says the premiums that AWB was achieving through its wheat export monopoly have been severely eroded.\\n\\nSA farmers help fire ravaged neighbours\\nFarmers in South Australia\\'s south-east are donating truckloads of hay to their neighbours across the border in the wake of the Grampians bushfires.\\nIn just a few days, farmers have donated 250 tonnes of hay, as well as agistment for cattle.\\nThey say that is just the beginning.\\nFodder drive coordinator Peter O\\'Conner says he has been overwhelmed by the response.\\n\"All the hay that\\'s going this week has all gone from places that have donated one load or up to two loads of hay,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve got one man that\\'s donated two full loads and the rest are all one loads, straight loads that we\\'re moving this week.\\n\\nFloodwaters close highway\\nA major highway between the Northern Territory and Western Australia remains blocked by floodwaters today.\\nThe Victoria River has cut the Victoria Highway and also flooded the remote Pigeon Hole Aboriginal community.\\nStockman Simon Ham describes the relocation of a hundred people to higher ground.\\n\"They had all their vehicles moved out of the community and they had a few camps set up and they were moving more people and belongings out with a couple of boats, just onto higher ground, only 500 metres from the community,\" he said.\\n\"They are up on a sandstone ridge at the moment and I think the river heights might be up for a little longer but I think it [the Victoria River] will start going down.\"\\n\\nGrain company sold for $9m\\nTasmania\\'s main grain company has changed hands for the second time in just three years.\\nThe former state-owned Tasmanian Grain Elevators Board has been sold to local agribusiness Roberts Limited for about $9 million.\\nThe deal includes silos at Launceston, Devonport and Powranna in northern Tasmania.\\nJohn Macleod from Roberts Limited says the company bid when the board was first privatised.\\n\"We were very disappointed we weren\\'t successful at that point of time,\" he said.\\n\\nWine workers stop work\\nWorkers at Hardy Wines\\' Stanley winery in south-western New South Wales have walked off the job for the second time in a week.\\nForty staff walked out this morning in a dispute over a new enterprise bargaining agreement.\\nThe stopwork comes just as the region\\'s wine grape crush gets under way.\\nHardy Wines took the matter to the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) on Friday.\\n\\nWool body eyes sportswear industry\\nThe $50 billion global sportswear industry is the new target of wool promotion body, Australian Wool Innovation (AWI).\\nAWI is showing wool blend t-shirts and casual wear to manufacturers this week at the largest trade show for the industry being held in Germany.\\nAWI\\'s Len Stephens says although wool-blend sportswear will be at the pricier end of the market, shoppers are willing to pay more.\\n\"The sports apparel market sector is one of the biggest and certainly the fastest growing apparel sector in the world, and it\\'s no secret that wool hasn\\'t had a very big share of that market at all,\" he said.\\n\"The level of wool, particularly Australian merino wool in the sports market is really almost below the radar.\\n\\nOrganisation to step up banning rodeos campaign\\nTasmania\\'s rodeo industry is under sustained attack from animal rights activists after another animal had to be destroyed at a weekend event.\\nA bucking horse was put down after breaking a leg at Ulverstone on Saturday.\\nTwo weeks ago, a bull was destroyed after apparently breaking its back during a bull-riding competition at Carrick.\\nThe owner of both animals, Brian Fish, says they were unfortunate accidents and not an animal welfare issue.\\nBut Emma Haswell from Against Animal Cruelty Tasmania says her organisation will up its efforts to have rodeos banned.\\n\\nSnails used in cancer research\\nNew research is under way to investigate whether South Australian sea snails could eventually be used to treat cancer.\\nUntil now the state\\'s snail population has been virtually unexplored but Flinders University hopes to discover beneficial compounds in predatory sea snails, known as whelks.\\nMarine biologist Dr Kirsten Benkendorff says the work follows research overseas, where clinical trials are now investigating anti-cancer properties.\\n\"The whelks that I\\'m looking at at the moment are not currently harvested and not really considered a useful resource so I think that there\\'s a lot of potential economic benefits from that side of things,\" she said.\\n\\nProcessors fail to meet kangaroo meat demand\\nInternational demand for kangaroo meat is putting pressure on Australian processors.\\nDespite high prices, harvesting quotas are not being met leaving a big gap in the market.\\nPhil Franolick from King River International Processors in Perth says Europeans are attracted to the meat\\'s low fat content and Russians are consuming large amounts of kangaroo sausages and mince.\\n\"As far as I know every skerrick of manufactured meat that is produced by human consumption processors virtually goes to the Russian market now,\" he said.\\n\\nPeople warned to be on snake alert\\nWith temperatures soaring this summer, particularly in southern Australia, snakes are on the move.\\nPeople are being warned to keep their eyes open out in the paddock, especially in areas hit by bushfires, with snakes forced from their usual habitat.\\nMaria Dovey from Reptile Rescue Tasmania has these words of advice.\\n\"Any people who are regularly outdoors, whether they be camping, bush walking, people who\\'re on the land working, they must always carry at least two bandages with them and a mobile phone,\" she said.\\n\\nAerial spraying begins to control locust threat\\nVictoria\\'s high country farmers have begun aerial spraying to try to control the threat of locusts.\\nIt is the first time locust plagues have made it to the region, with continued rain and warm weather assisting breeding conditions.\\nPastures and crops have already been wiped out by the pest.\\n\\nInjury won\\'t stop baton runner\\nA southern Queensland cattle farmer says a knee injury will not stop him running in the Queen\\'s baton relay today in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games.\\nStanthorpe\\'s Bill Bonner travelled to Coffs Harbour in New South Wales to run his leg of the relay.\\nAnd he says injury will not prevent him from making the 500 metre dash.\\n\"About two weeks ago I was jumping off my motorbike and twisted a ligament in my knee and I haven\\'t been able to do more than walk since,\" he said.\\n\"But I promise you I will run that baton because you get such an adrenalin rush that I think you could only have one leg and you could still run it.\"\\n\\nThe NZ apple debate continues\\nIn a New Zealand newspaper on the weekend, members of the New Zealand apple industry voiced concern regarding the legitimacy of the \"science\" used in the draft Import Risk Analysis put out last month by Biosecurity Australia. The draft Import Risk Analysis (IRA) determines the risk of fireblight and other pests and diseases if New Zealand apples are imported into Australia.\\nUnder the World Trade Organisation\\'s rules Australia can refuse the importation of New Zealand apples if they are able to provide scientific evidence of a substantial disease or pest risk. But according to the New Zealand apple growers, \"professional\" scientific evidence shows that mature apples imported into Australia pose no risk of fireblight. However the spokesperson for the New Zealand based Australian Apple Access Group Phil Allison says Biosecurity Australia has not provided the mathematical model used to determine the \"scientific\" evidence stated in the draft IRA.\\nA spokesperson for Biosecurity Australia said: \"the formulas used in the risk assessment are provided in the Draft Import Risk Analysis Report on New Zealand Apples, which was published last December for anyone to read. A competent modeller can reproduce the model used in the risk analysis from the formulas given in the report.\" The chairman of the fireblight task force, John Corboy, says the response and concern from New Zealand apple growers regarding the draft IRA is not surprising, but Australia has to be able to exercise its right to refuse the apples based on the scientific evidence it has presented in the IRA.\\n\\nYounger trees producing more pears\\nA trial plot of young williams pear trees has produced fruit three years after they were planted. Usually the trees don\\'t produce fruit until they\\'re about five or six years old. The trees are part of a five year experimental project, funded by SPC Ardmona through the Canned Fruits Association, Horticulture Australia Limited and the Lenne family orchard - where the trial plot is located.\\nHorticulture consultant Bas Van Den Ende says the aim of the project is to increase the number of williams pears grown in the future by encouraging the younger trees to produce earlier than usual.\\n\\nLocal federal National MP supports AWB single desk\\nThe federal Member for Parkes, John Cobb, has brought into the debate over the future of AWB. This comes as the Cole inquiry continues to examines AWB\\'s role in the Iraq oil-for-food program. On top of this the National party will today try and reinvent itself. Mr Cobb says he supports the single desk and producers must become far more pro-active. On the issue of the National party\\'s future, he says they will make themselves different from the Liberals. Mr Cobb says they do represent regional areas far better then his Liberal colleagues.\\n\\nFish deaths believed to be due to lack of oxygen\\nThe Department of Primary Industries is investigating a big fish kill in the Lachlan River upstream of the Lake Cargelligo Weir. Between 150 and 200 native fish died in the incident earlier this month. District Fisheries Officer Phillip McCarthy says murray cod, bream and golden and silver perch were killed but no introduced species died. He says inquiries suggest the deaths were the result of an increased water flow not chemical poisoning.\\n\\nVegetable industry concern on labels\\nAgriculture group AUSVEG says food labelling laws in Australia are a joke because nobody follows them and enforcement of the rules is non-existent. AUSVEG says consumers are still being fooled into thinking they\\'re buying Australian products because of false or poor labelling.\\n\\nRed tape slows west Kimberley horticulture\\nThe Kimberley could be WA\\'s food bowl with its top soil, available water and sunshine all year round - though its facing hurdles to expand. Sweet potato grower Paul Higgins still relies on a generator and says Broome horticulturalists are the only ones in the state not connected to the grid. He and his neighbours have been applying to get a nine kilometre extension to the current grid system to bring them into line. A spokesperson from Western Power says it is possible, though it\\'s up to customers to pay for their connection costs, regardless of the distance from the existing grid. Land acquisition is also causing headaches. Mr Higgins purchased adjoining country last June, though still hasn\\'t received title. He can\\'t improve the land until this is cleared. \"All the issues have been resolved - area surveyed, native title issues have been put to bed, monies have been paid, but still we don\\'t have land title. We can\\'t clear the land, apply for water title, can\\'t do anything,\" he said. The Minister for Planning and Infrastructure, Alannah McTiernan, says the seven month delay is regrettable and Mr Higgins should have been made aware of the hold up in the West Australian Planning Office because the land was not correctly zoned. Though Ms McTiernan says the delay may have worked in his favour, given the land was sold at 2004 property prices. Mr Higgins still waits for the official all clear before he can start ploughing the Pindan for more potatoes.\\n\\nRichmond River to stay open to fishers\\nThe Department of Primary Industries has decided against closing the Richmond River to commercial and recreational fishers in the wake of last week\\'s fish kill. About 300 dead fish and eels were discovered near Wardell last Thursday, when oxygen levels in the water dropped alarmingly. The acting director of fisheries management, Anthony Hirst, says inspectors will take further samples from the river tomorrow.\\n\\nRural woman finalist\\nThe next 10 days may seem like an eternity for one at least one Rosebank farmer.

Charley DeFegley, who\\'s the Ararat VFF branch secretary and a CFA divisional commander, said he felt not enough burning off had been carried out and this had contributed to the destructive force of the fire. But the Department of Sustainability\\'s fire manager for the Horsham district and incident controller for the Grampians fires, Geoff Evans, says the agency has a proactive burning off policy. He says burning off is hampered because some landowners are not keen about burning off beside their properties and the weather does not allow controlled burns at some times of the year, giving a very small window of opportunity. He says there is also strong division within the community about whether more or less burning off should be carried out in the national park. But Mr Evans says about 5,000 to 8,000 hectares of the park are burnt off every year.\\n\\nFarmers and ag agencies get speedy aid to farmers\\nThe state government has announced it will commit millions of dollars to the recovery effort for the new year bushfires including the blaze in the Grampians and a ministerial task force is to start assessing need. The government says it will also help landowners facing hardship as a result of their water supplies being used by firefighting. But already, Department of Primary Industry officers, the Victorian Farmers Federation, haulage contractors and farmers all over western Victoria, have been working at a grassroots level to help fire affected landowners. Hundreds of tonnes of hay, 21 semi-loads of which was brought to a collection point at Moyston from Warrnambool yesterday, has been donated to farmers who need fodder for their surviving animals. Bruce McKay says he has been on farms helping to put sheep down and fixing fencing in the Willaura area. Tim Wrench from the Warrnambool Coop says people came from all around the area to donate hay. Haulier Scott Wilson from Koroit said when he went onto farms to collect hay people said \"just load up until you\\'re full\". Neil James from the DPI says hay is being donated from New South Wales and South Australia. Charlie DeFegeley from the VFF says the response has been amazing.\\n\\nFuel price, weather blamed for hike in fresh food costs\\nFuel prices and fluctuating weather conditions are being blamed for a 12 per cent jump in the cost of fresh food over the past year.\\nThe latest food industry analysis from Rabobank shows consumers are paying more for their milk, meat, fruit and vegetables.\\nBut Rabobank\\'s Dr Ben Russell says the money is going to manufacturers and processors, not growers.\\n\"In the case of passing on higher fuel prices it\\'s to the contrary because farmers have got to pay higher fuel prices as well as see the retail prices of the products they\\'re producing going up,\" he said.\\n\\nLow prices, falling demand slow down wheat exports\\nWheat exports have slowed due to low prices and falling demand from Australia\\'s traditional markets.\\nDespite some sales to Egypt, other markets including Iraq, Pakistan, China and India have failed to deliver the expected number of contracts.\\nWith the second largest global crop on record, competition for tenders is particularly fierce.\\nGrains trader Lloyd George says there are a range of factors for the slow-down.\\n\"Certainly Iraq has been an important customer of Australia\\'s over a period of time, put in pretty significant tonnages and over the recent months AWB hasn\\'t been exporting the quantities we have in the past,\" he said.\\n\"But there\\'s a whole bunch of broader issues out there as well. A lot of the markets whereby Australia would hope to sell the quantity of the harvest into are the same markets that are quiet this year.\"\\n\\nIraq market\\nAWB\\'s national pool manager David Johnson denies the oil-for-food inquiry is having an impact on trade and says Australia has not lost Iraq as a major market.\\nHe says AWB submitted a tender to supply a million tonnes of wheat to Iraq last week.\\n\"We\\'ll be looking to participate in that tender, absolutely,\" he said.\\n\"Probably relatively, compared to the structure of the market in previous years, this pool return might look a little different but the world market is different.\\n\"I think it\\'s just a fact that the export business is extremely quiet and I think you\\'d find the same comments from other exporting countries around the world.\"\\nAWB has announced an increase to new season pool estimates, lifting the returns for hard wheat by $2.00 a tonne and for noodle grades by $4.00 a tonne.\\nThere is a mixed outlook for other grains.\\nRecord soy bean harvests in the US, Ukraine and Brazil mean there is a large global supply of the canola alternative, which will put pressure on oil seed prices in

supplies of malting barley really come out of Europe in August, so some time away yet.\\n\"Once the Chinese re-emerge we look forward to a strong selling program.\" \\n\\nInquiry chief\\nMeanwhile the head of the oil-for-food inquiry has yet to respond to complaints that the investigation is not being conducted fairly.\\nCounsel for AWB told the hearing yesterday that witnesses had been ambushed and ridiculed.\\nThe comments were in response to criticism from Commissioner Terence Cole last week that AWB\\'s level of cooperation was a facade.\\nAWB\\'s lawyer said Commissioner Cole\\'s expectations were unreasonable because of the time available to prepare witness statements and the availability of documents.\\nIn another development, the New South Wales Farmers Association says it is prepared to fight to maintain the single desk for wheat exports.\\nDespite keeping a low profile since the start of the inquiry, the association has today come out in support of the current monopoly export system.\\nGrains committee chairman Angus McLaren says growing pressure from opponents of the single desk is concerning but grain growers are prepared for any challenge to their marketing system.\\n\"I think the most important thing we can do and what we\\'ve been concentrating on doing is gathering our thoughts and doing research and preparing for the battle that we think

McMillan, east of Melbourne, is drafting a private member\\'s bill to ban imports from any country with the disease fireblight.\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has rejected the bill, saying it would also affect a wide range of imports and exports.\\nBut Mr Broadbent says he will push on with the plan.\\n\"Mr McGauran is the Minister but he doesn\\'t actually have many orchards in his seat of Gippsland does he?\" Mr Broadbent said.\\n\"So I don\\'t suppose he\\'s exposed as closely to the issue and as passionately to the issue as many of the backbench members are across the

have petered out before the start of the local harvest but this year a record New Zealand crop has led to a 50 per cent jump in exports to Australia.\\nNorth Queensland\\'s Shepard avocados will be the first to be picked here.\\nShepard Australia chairman Jim Kochi says growers need to focus on sending quality fruit to the markets.\\n\"They certainly don\\'t have enough people left in New Zealand to consume their crop, I think they\\'re all here in Australia ... most of them and so the rest of it is coming to Australia and it is a large volume of fruit,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt urged to get tougher on enforcing food labelling laws\\nFruit and vegetable growers are calling on the Federal Government to get tougher on states which do not enforce country-of-origin labelling laws.\\nProducer group AUSVEG says some states are not pushing for new laws to be implemented on fresh and packaged produce, and that is misleading consumers.\\nChief executive John Roach says the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) needs to look at the issue again.\\n\"Excuse the pun out of the vegetable industry but you do need a reasonable amount of carrot and you do need a little bit of stick,\" he said.\\n\"And what has not happened with any consistency across Australia is that last one, that bit of stick, it is not consistent - it varies hugely and often there are cases where it doesn\\'t exist at all.\"\\nThe ACCC says the labelling issue has been looked at and the authority is satisfied with current compliance.\\n\\nGrowers to get less for currant

code is being implemented after a public outcry over rodeo practices.\\nThere have been two very public incidents at rodeos in the past fortnight that have outraged animal rights activists and the television watching public.\\nA bull was put down after dragging its paralysed hindquarters behind it as it left the ring and on Saturday a bucking horse was put down in the arena after it broke a leg as it exited the chute.\\nThe public outcry has forced the State Government to declare a mandatory set of regulations will soon be enforced on all rodeos before a permit is issued.\\nA major requirement will be for a vet to be on site at all events, rather than only on call.\\n\\nCamp cooks in demand\\nCamp cooks and grader drivers are proving the hardest jobs to fill on cattle stations in northern Australia this year.\\nThe lure of high-paying mining jobs has kept many away from the Kimberley, in particular.\\nWhile they have been lucky to get a full team at Flora Valley Station near Halls Creek, manager Wayne Bean says camp cooks are a dying breed.\\n\"One time, once people finished working as stockhands or ringers on stations they found their little niche in life, either cooking for the station, or driving the grader or running as a bore runner but that just doesn\\'t seem to be happening now,\" he said.\\n\"People are drifting off into the mines and other big corporations and there\\'s still a few that seem who enjoy being on the stations, and it\\'s not about money for them.\\n\\nFlooding causes detour\\nFloodwaters in the Northern Territory are still

halted\\nThe Federal Government has halted live cattle exports to Egypt in the wake of mistreatment claims.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran says $350,000 was spent on improving the treatment of cattle at the Bassatin Abattoir in Egypt after cruelty concerns were first raised in 2003.\\nBut Channel Nine\\'s 60 Minutes program last night showed footage of cattle having their tendons cut, which the program says was filmed last month.\\nMr McGauran says his decision to halt the trade while the claims are investigated, is not an extreme reaction.\\n\"We shouldn\\'t be defensive about this,\" he said.\\n\"Where allegations are made, no matter how ill-founded or how lacking in evidence we must confront it head-on if we are to retain the confidence of the general public and fulfil our responsibilities to farmers.\"\\nMeat and Livestock Australia says the ban sets a bad precedent.\\nGeneral manager of live exports, Mike Hayward says he is certain the cattle showed in the 60 Minutes footage were not from Australia.\\nAnd he denies suggestions little has changed since the cruelty claims were first raised three years ago.\\n\\nIraq will still buy Aust wheat, Vaile says\\nTrade Minister Mark Vaile has confirmed Iraq will continue to buy Australian wheat but not from current exporter AWB, which is facing claims it paid kickbacks to Saddam Hussein.\\nBut according to grains analysts Australian growers could stay shut out of Iraq until August.\\nWhile some grain exporters have already lodged applications to export to Iraq, grains analyst Lloyd George says the next Iraq wheat tender may not by for another four months.\\n\"Not having access to Iraq for maybe 60 per cent of the year would be significant,\" he said.\\nBut following his mission to Baghdad, Mr Vaile says Iraq could be ready to take as much as 350,000 tons of wheat a month, but cannot confirm any deal or when it may start.\\n\"There will be further tenders coming up in the short term, we need to look at what mechanisms need to be deployed in the meantime to get our wheat growers access to that,\" he said.\\nMeanwhile representatives from grain companies ABB Grain, CBH and Graincorp are meeting with federal politicians today.\\nWestern Australian Liberal Wilson Tuckey has organised the meeting to allow MPs to meet alternative grain traders and learn more about the grains industry.\\nABB\\'s managing director Michael Iwaniw says while his company is not advocating change to the wheat single desk, it is ready to take advantage of it.\\n\"If, and I stress if, the legislation were to change and if there were opportunities, and if perhaps we could assist in the marketing of wheat for the benefit of Australian growers then we will certainly look at it,\" he said.\\nA lecturer in business strategy at Melbourne Business School says grain growers would be better off without a single desk.\\nProfessor Paul Kerin says the oil-for-food inquiry justifies the need to introduce free competition, and let alternative exporters to enter the market.\\nProfessor Kerin says the ability to spread risk is the key for growers.\\n\"Under free competition, growers have a choice and if one of those traders messes up, then it\\'s not so much of a problem for growers because they can change to another trader,\" he said.\\n\"In fact, growers should have the right to punish a trader if they really mess up, and so growers will be better off.\\n\\nWool market expected to continue gaining ground\\nThe wool industry is closely watching how China reacts to climbing wool prices with the

from Elders Wool says despite some concern among buyers, the market should continue to gain ground.\\n\"We\\'ve got the largest offering of the season coming up this week, so obviously yes we are cautious and we\\'re seeing quite a bit of Chinese resistance at these levels,\" he said.\\n\\nHarvey Beef handover delayed\\nThe handover of Western Australia\\'s largest beef processor and exporter Harvey Beef has been delayed while the new owners try to strike a deal with workers.\\nThe Stark-Harmony consortium was due to takeover today but has asked for a one-week delay to allow workers to vote on a new enterprise bargaining agreement.\\nFeedlotter Paul O\\'Meehan who helped broker the Stark Harmony deal, says he hopes they can sign off on the deal by next Monday.\\n\"The new owners are better off getting these problems sorted and starting with a fresh slate rather than going into business and not being organised,\" he said.\\n\\nCampaigners worried about approval of \\'terminator technology\\'\\nGene ethics campaigners are concerned a technology which stops seeds breeding naturally will be approved for commercial cropping in Australia.\\nMembers of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, including Australia, banned \"terminator technology\" in 2000, when global protests forced biotech company Monsanto to state it would not commercialise the process.\\nBut Bob Phelps from the Gene Ethics Network says the Federal Government is now reconsidering its stance which would threaten the natural biodiversity of seed crops.\\n\"At a recent meeting in Granada in Spain, the Australian Government was arguing that the current ban should be modified,\" he said.\\n\"The officials are saying that there is no ban on terminator in Australia at the moment and that any application that was made to the Australian regulators would be examined on a case by case basis.\"\\nBut Dr Jim Peacock from the CSIRO\\'s Plant Industries does not see the

community of Gove.\\nFurther west, the Darwin River has been found to be the only place in the nation where the weed is producing viable seed.\\nRegional weed officer Steve Wingrave says that explains the rapid spread of the weed along 11 kilometres of the river.\\n\"It\\'s an ornamental plant, the same as roses or any plant you have in your garden,\" he said.\\n\"Lots of them are hybrid varieties so they are not going to produce viable seeds.\\n\"It turns out that we have got a variety which is producing viable seed. But it mightn\\'t be a result of the variety we have got.\\n\\nFarmers look to overhaul image\\nA campaign to overhaul the image of Australian farmers kicks off in Queensland today.\\nThe \"Every Family needs a Farmer\" promotion is being run by Agforce and features the Coe family, from Durong, in the state\\'s south.\\nCattle and grain producer Karen Coe hopes it will change city people\\'s perceptions of agriculture.\\n\"Just even on small terms we have friends come out and say goodness you\\'ve got lots of trees and they don\\'t fully understand that the way we farm these days is very different to driving a tractor around the paddock and ploughing, ploughing and ploughing,\" she said.\\n\\nNew marine species found in reef survey\\nSeveral new species of fish, plants and at least one new species of crab have been discovered in a big new survey of the Great Barrier Reef.\\nDr Roland Pitcher from the CSIRO says scientists spent more than 300 days at sea covering 536,000 square kilometres of the reef from Cape York to Fraser Island.\\n\"We\\'ve seen a number of new fish, possibly a new pipehorse and maybe a new species of crab at least,\" he said.\\n\"And we can also confirm that there\\'s been a number of species that have been confirmed in Australia waters for the first time.\\n\\nABARE Outlook 2006 conference\\nToday\\'s National Rural News was broadcast live from the ABARE Outlook conference in Canberra.\\nMatt O\\'Sullivan: \"The Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics is taking its best shot at predicting what\\'s going to happen in the farming and mining sectors over the next 12 months. It\\'s fairly good news so far, depending on how you look at it, because it appears there won\\'t be too many nasty surprises for the nation\\'s farmers this year. James Martin has been talking to ABARE to get the latest, what\\'s the story James?\"\\nJames Martin: \"Matt, I don\\'t usually like using the word normal when it comes to forecasting, but this is as normal an outlook as what I can remember. It\\'s a story of continuing to build after drought, but with that predictable warning that without greater improvement in world trade conditions, the terms of trade for farmers are really going to squeeze. ABARE tells us though that perhaps more of the same is not necessarily a bad thing. His morning, for instance, it\\'s telling us that the grain harvest for 05-06 is the second highest on record. We\\'ve also seen, of course, good movement of beef into Japan, and we\\'re even seeing some rebound in the wool price as well.\"\\nMatt O\\'Sullivan: \"So it seems that there is going to be higher production in many areas in the time ahead. Is that going to translate to more money in farmers\\' pockets?\"\\nJames Martin: \"Not necessarily. Overall we\\'re seeing export earnings at a record $134b, that\\'s including minerals and energy. Now in the farm sector alone, those export earnings are tipped at $29.6b in 06-07, so that\\'s up 6 per cent on last year. But the warning is commodity prices are going to decline across many areas, so while we have increased production pushing up export earnings from wheat, rice, barley, sugar, wine, lamb, live exports and dairy, we also have prices for many items falling. Overall, ABARE says commodity prices in the ag sector will fall by about 1.7 per cent, following a rise in 05-06 of about 1.4 per cent. So the bottom line I suppose, the net value of farm production, will actually fall to around $6b in 06-07. That\\'s down 6 per cent.\"\\nMatt O\\'Sullivan: \"What about the economic picture being painted by ABARE\\'s chief, Brian Fisher?\"\\nJames Martin: \"Economic growth should continue at about 4 per cent, which it has been doing over the last 12 months or so. There has been talk of that \"super-commodities cycle\" which is helping growth in the minerals and energy sector actually cascading into agriculture. The message from Dr Fisher though is that won\\'t happen:\"\\n\"There have been people talking about the notion that we\\'ve got a super commodities cycle that a whole lot of the action that we\\'ve seen in minerals and energy will then cascade into agriculture. I think frankly that\\'s a bit simplistic. A lot of the story in the case of agriculture is on the supply side. We are as I said before seeing a good strong demand, but in the case of agriculture, it\\'s both a demand and supply story\".\\n\"Brian Fisher also says that farm costs, things like fertiliser and fuel, will actually increase by about one per cent. Now on oil, the benchmark for oil prices, that\\'s West Texas Intermediate Crude, that\\'ll stay high in the near term, but over the medium term, down from the current 65 dollars a barrel down below $40 a barrel by 2010. On the dollar, a moderate depreciation, around US73c for 06-07, continuing down though by 2010-11. That\\'s a long way ahead, but Brian Fisher\\'s saying perhaps around US65c for the Australian dollar.\"\\nAlan Oster (National Australia Bank): \"We think the Aussie dollar is probably going to get down to the levels that ABARE\\'s talking about, except that we think it\\'s going to come down a lot quicker. So we expect something like 68c by this time next year.\"\\nMatt O\\'Sullivan: \"And that\\'s going to have a big impact on exports?\"\\nJames Martin: \"It clearly helps in some senses, in the sense that it means you\\'re more competitive, but if you\\'re on the import side, the oil price goes down in US dollars, but it really doesn\\'t go down at all.\"\\nMatt O\\'Sullivan: \"Now I don\\'t think you\\'ve got very good news about rural commodity prices?\"\\nJames Martin: \"Again part of this is that we have a faster fall in the currency, is that in our view, when we look at US dollar agricultural prices, we\\'re down around ten per cent. Now part of that is beef, which has come off really high levels, and we think sugar eventually will start to slow down as well. So we\\'re expecting prices to come back, and the volumes broadly to offset that, so you get those different effects coming through.\\nMatt O\\'Sullivan: \"So that might be a faster impact than what ABARE\\'s predicting?\"\\nJames Martin: \"Yes.\"\\nMatt O\\'Sullivan: \"You\\'ve also been talking about continuing concerns about the labour shortage, particularly skilled labour?\"\\nJames Martin: \"Yes, when we run our business surveys we find it is very difficult, in fact, even in December this year, it\\'s more difficult according to business to get suitable labour than any time, including the late 80s.\"\\nMatt O\\'Sullivan: \"So the concern is always, will that show up in wages?\"\\nJames Martin: \"At this stage, the good news is nothing\\'s happened. That\\'s why the Reserve Bank is still talking about if we\\'re going to move rates it\\'s more likely up than down. At the end of the day, our view on rates will be, they won\\'t do anything, but the wages one is critical, and if they see any signs of wage pressures starting to move up, then they will pull the trigger.\"\\nMatt O\\'Sullivan: \"Will the importation of labour be likely to hold off wage increases?\"\\nJames Martin: \"To the extent that you can take some pressure off by increasing the level of immigration, that clearly does help. And in the rural sector we know about difficulties of getting people in to help with crops, so it helps there. But at the end of the day, I think yes, there\\'s an element of that, but I think also the domestic part of the economy is really starting to slow a bit as well, so I think unemployment\\'s going to go from 5.2, 5.3 up to about 5.7, 5.8, and that will help. So I think the fact is that within the economy as such, you\\'re probably not going to have to do anything.\"\\nMatthew O\\'Sullivan: \"Around Australia, you\\'re listening to a special broadcast of National Rural News from the ABARE Outlook Conference in Canberra.\\n\"Well, the Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran told the conference this morning that the NFF and the government aren\\'t in total agreement about imported workers being a solution to the labour shortage, but certainly agreed there is a problem.\\n\"John Roach joins us now, he\\'s the chief executive of vegetable grower group Ausveg, John is this a critical issue for the horticulture industry?\"\\nJohn Roach: \"I think not only critical to the horticulture industry, it\\'s critical to rural Australia, and I\\'d probably go so far as to say that rural Australia\\'s undergoing significant change in its labour content that it will require, particularly in the next five to 10 years.\"\\nMatthew O\\'Sullivan: \"What about these guest worker schemes? Are they having an impact in your sector?\"\\nJohn Roach: \"If I look at other countries, yes it does. If I look at New Zealand, part of the horticulture industry in New Zealand does use what I call cheaper labour. What they\\'re doing there is bringing it it in, upskilling it there, and sending it back to those countries as part of their aid projects, for example. We in Australia don\\'t have that opportunity at the moment, but if I look at the farm unit in itself, as vegetable growers, much of the innovation happens on small to medium farm businesses. It\\'s not the big end of town in vegetable production. So that area is where the innovation happens. You\\'d require less labour in that, but you\\'d need more specialised labour.\\nMatthew O\\'Sullivan: \"Is there a need to protect smaller farmers in the future?\"\\nJohn Roach: \"It\\'s more about going to informed choice. The vegetable industry in particular will segment itself into three areas. One is larger production, larger farms, working on lowering costs. The middle section is about innovation, smaller farm units being out there on the cutting edge. The last third of the industry produces about five per cent of production. I think providing informed choice for that sector, of what they actually do with their lives and their farms and their assets, I think it\\'s really important for Australia on social content to be able to allow those people to make informed choice about whether they wish to grow, or not grow and depart.\"\\nMatthew O\\'Sullivan: \"We\\'ve also heard a lot over the past few years about the significant of China to the global economy, and Australian agriculture. Reporter Sally Davison has been looking at the impact of China on the world economy. Sal, this week is critical in terms of China\\'s future in the global market?\"\\nSally Davison: \"That\\'s right, the National People\\'s Congress is releasing its five year plan, a blueprint for national policy makers. This will affect everything from urbanisation, migration into major cities, to unemployment. But Yiping Hup from Asia CitiGroup says the energy sector will be most affect by these changes. The Chinese Government has said it wants to increase energy efficiency by 20 per cent in the next 20 years, by focussing on environmentally friendly industries. So the international energy sector is eagerly awaiting the release of the Chinese Government\\'s five-year plan.\"\\n\\nFresh roadkill sought for WA snake study\\nRoadkill is set to help scientists

brand new tax.\\n\"\"I guess the issue is, how transparent is the process? how independent is it?\\n\\nMinisters urged to reject trucking fees hike\\nFarmers are calling on state and federal transport ministers to reject a proposal to increase trucking charges, ahead of a vote on the new fees tomorrow.\\nThe National Transport Commission wants registration costs for B-doubles and road trains to rise by 37 per cent, and fuel taxes for heavy trucks to climb by 10 per cent.\\nThe Federal Government, along with the ACT, South Australia and Tasmania have already said they will vote against the charges.\\nBen Fargher from the National Farmers Federation, says the increases go beyond cost recovery for the trucking sector, and farmers will end up wearing them.\\n\"We need the most efficient freight transport task, the most efficient mode in this country and we need to look at the policy between road and rail,\" he said.\\n\"Indeed the Productivity Commission has just been tasked with looking at that.\\n\\nOil-for-food inquiry terms widened\\nThe Federal Government has widened the oil-for-food inquiry, to include an internal AWB investigation into the allegations that kickbacks were paid to Saddam Hussein.\\n\\nCyclone Larry devastates FNQ farms\\nThe most powerful cyclone to cross the north Queensland coast in 20 years is continuing to cause havoc as it moves west.\\nThe core of the category 5 Cyclone Larry crossed the coast near Innisfail, around 7:00am AEST, with wind speeds of 290 kilometres an hour.\\nBanana grower Naomi King says their property has taken a heavy battering.\\n\"We\\'ve lost most of our trees, we\\'ve lost a fair bit of the car shed, we\\'ve lost another shed just over from our house and it looks like the iron on the lime shed just over the back of the house is lifting up too,\" she said.\\n\\nFarmers shouldering vegetation cost, says McGauran\\nThe Federal Agriculture Minister has told a national conference that farmers are bearing too much of the cost of conserving native vegetation.\\nThe Vegetation Futures Conference at Albury in southern New South Wales is looking at how to balance conservation with production on farmland.\\nMore than 400 scientists, government representatives and land managers are attending the four-day conference.\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran threw the cat amongst the pigeons in his opening address, saying that some state legislation is too focused on protection, sacrificing farm production.\\nHe has announced funding of $2 million over the next two years for pilot projects to develop more flexible approaches to managing native vegetation.\\nThe project will look at things like incentive payments and offsets.\\nHe has also launched a comprehensive database containing information about Australia\\'s native vegetation.\\nMeanwhile Mr McGauran has rejected suggestions the Government could buy water from irrigators to improve the health of the Murray River.\\nParliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has floated the idea to meet the targets of the Living Murray program, because not enough water savings have been found.\\nBut Mr McGauran says it is too early to talk about entering the water market.\\n\\nJapan\\'s mad cow case worries cattle industry\\nThe Cattle Council is worried about a consumer backlash against beef in Japan, after the latest outbreak of mad cow disease.\\nJapan has confirmed its first case of the disease in cattle specifically raised to provide meat.\\nAll 22 previously confirmed cases of the disease were in dairy cattle.\\nCouncil President Bill Bray says Japan is our biggest customer for beef exports, and the Japanese consumer is very conscious of food safety.\\n\"It is a concern, it\\'s a wagyu cow that\\'s some 14 years old and it is the 23rd case that\\'s been identified in Japan,\" he said.\\n\\nRecord-busting market growth expected to continue\\nAnalysts are predicting the Australian sharemarket will continue its record growth, after it broke the 5,000 benchmark yesterday, for the first time since listing in 1987.\\nHartley\\'s director John Featherby, says the strength of the Australian mining and energy sector bodes well for the year\\'s trading.\\n\"Well if you measure it by the All Ordinaries index, it\\'s going to be pushing close to 5,500 by the end of the calendar year, in my opinion,\" he said.\\n\\nNZ Govt accused of ignoring farmers\\nWool prices are down, it is hard for dairy farmers to break even, and the government is interfering - it might sound familiar, but those concerns are coming out of New Zealand, not Australia.\\nNew Zealand\\'s Reserve Bank has cut its national growth forecast, citing a seven-year low in farm incomes.\\nAnd while farm businesses across the ditch contribute to 15 per cent of the economy, farmers say they are being ignored by government.\\nDon Nicolson, from the Federated Farmers of New Zealand, says the Government is over taxing and interfering, and it is hard to make a buck.\\n\"You would wonder whether they take notice of us,\" he said.\\n\"We have been continually telling them the same thing for many years: we don\\'t need government assistance in our lives.\\n\"We just need the framework to operate our business to be as free and as friendly as we can have it.\\n\\nWheat survey aims to find profitable secrets\\nA survey of wheat growers in Victoria\\'s Wimmera is under way, to try to determine what makes a profitable farmer.\\nDespite a good harvest this year, growers were hit hard when grain prices plummeted by up to $30 a tonne.\\nResearchers are hoping to find out what factors enabled some farmers to make a profit, while others had to sell their crops below the cost of production.\\nJohn Williams, from the University of Melbourne, says the results will be compared with similar data from the United States.\\n\"One of the things that I\\'ve found over the last ten years is that growers don\\'t have a good grasp of their cost of production,\" he said.\\n\\nJapanese BSE case compounds US beef fears\\nThe US beef industry fears even longer odds of recovering its Japanese market, after that country\\'s first case of mad cow disease in beef cattle.\\nUS beef producers have always expected to have an uphill battle once Japan resumed imports from the US.\\nBut Japan\\'s 23rd confirmed BSE case, and the first in beef cattle, may cause even longer odds in that market.\\nAmerican Meat Institute spokesman John Reddington points to recent Japanese press reports.\\n\"It\\'s going to be pretty difficult battle for the United States to change consumers\\' minds about the safety of our product.\\n\"Our major competitor, when we get back into that market, is going to be Australia.\"\\n\\nHigher sheep prices forecast amid steep demand\\nThe live export industry says it will be forced to offer higher premiums to sheep producers to meet demand.\\nWhile producers have moved away from breeding heavy boat sheep towards the prime lamb market, the live trade expects increased demand for mutton in Europe.\\nGary Tapscott, from the South Australian Livestock Exporters Association, says with more shipments out of the eastern states expected over the next few months, the trade will be demanding merino wethers coming into winter.\\n\\nVeg growers urge greater marketing mix\\nVegetable producers want to join forces with other rural industries to try to increase sales.\\nPeak grower group Ausveg is looking at cross-commodity marketing, as one of the ideas included in a new industry strategy.\\nChief executive, John Roach, says with increasing global pressures on primary producers, the time may be right for more co-operation\\n\"There is real leverage to be had with vegetables in particular co-marketing product with other rural commodities, such as seafood, such as meat, start making whole of meal solutions, particularly on an export focus,\" he said.\\n\\nCalls to withdraw ministers\\' control over truck rego\\nThe rail industry wants decisions on truck registration costs to be taken away from transport ministers, after they rejected a plan to increase charges on large vehicles.\\nThe trucking industry says it could not afford the proposed 37 per cent increase in rego costs for B-doubles and road trains, and a 10 per cent rise in fuel taxes for heavy trucks.\\nBut the rail industry says only 2 per cent of trucking operators will benefit.\\nBrian Nye from the Australasian Railway Association says there still needs to be fundamental reform of road and rail pricing.\\n\"I\\'m not arguing that the trucking industry doesn\\'t pay,\" he said.\\n\"What we\\'re saying is that smaller vehicles are cross-subsidising heavier vehicles and it\\'s the heavier vehicles that are doing the damage.\\n\"So, yes the trucking industry can say \\'Yes we are paying a fair amount but it\\'s the way the formula\\'s worked out\\', and this was trying to redress some of that.\\nBut the Victorian Transport Minister says the increases would have jeopardised rural businesses, already battling high transport costs.\\nPeter Batchelor says there needs to be a uniform approach to truck rego fees, and uncertainty over Federal Government funding for freight infrastructure also needs to be resolved.\\n\\nDoctors warned of racial abuse in wake of Patel scandal\\nOverseas trained doctors are being warned against practising in rural Australia, because they could face racist abuse from both patients and colleagues.\\nThe Australian Doctors Trained Overseas Group says fallout has not abated, after the \"Dr Death\" case in Queensland.\\nMartin Stanley, from the Rural and Remote Workforce Agencies Group, says a positive campaign about the work of overseas trained doctors is urgently needed.\\n\"I think there is a lack of understanding,\" he said.\\n\"I think there\\'s an assumption that some communities make, that there are doctors all over the place and it\\'s just a matter of picking one to come to their community.\\n\"I think we all, collectively, need to keep telling some of the positive stories about what overseas trained doctors are doing in local communities.\"\\nDr Adel Asaid trained in Egypt, and has practised as a GP in the Victorian town of Elmore for the past eight years.\\nBut he says while getting to know the locals took some time, stories of racism in country areas are exaggerated.\\n\"It wasn\\'t an easy task for me, or even for the town, but the town actually was great, like the town accepted me and welcomed me so that made my life much easier,\" he said.\\n\\nGrowers count cost of cyclone Larry\\nFar north Queensland\\'s horticulture industry has been almost wiped out by cyclone Larry.\\nThe Category 5 cyclone has caused hundreds of millions of dollars damage to sugar and banana crops, along with the rest of the farming sector.\\nNinety per cent of Australia\\'s bananas come out of the Innisfail and Tully regions; at this stage most of the industry looks to have been lost.\\nJan Davis from horticulture\\'s representative group Growcom says the damage looks worse than anticipated.\\n\"Avocados are in the middle of harvest and probably 70 to 80 per cent of that crop\\'s gone. We\\'ve got significant damage reports coming in from tropical fruit. Very, very serious damage right across the sector,\" she said.\\nSugar cane along the coast from Tully to Cairns also copped the blow of the cyclone, with most of the Innisfail crop which faced 290 kilometre winds destroyed.\\nThe cyclone will have huge ramifications for jobs and local businesses in the affected districts, which heavily rely on the two crops that used to dominate the landscape: sugar and bananas.\\nThere have been calls for the State Government to help out with compensation.\\nIt says it is still assessing the damages.\\nThose heavy losses in the far north are expected to drive the price of bananas to above $40 a carton, or between $5 and $6 a kilo.\\nBut Tony Heidrich from the Australian Banana Growers Council is concerned about how growers in far north Queensland will rebuild.\\n\"If growers aren\\'t making any money, they can\\'t afford to keep staff above those which are essential to getting the farm back into production,\" he said.\\n\"And the question is as far as key people go, key employees, if you do have to let some of those go, whether they come back again.\"\\nRemote cattle stations in the Gulf of Carpentaria are apprehensive over what Cyclone Larry may bring to the already water-logged region.\\nStuart Zlotkowski of Wollogorang Station, says he is relieved to have turned off cattle months in advance.\\nIn the metric scale, the station has had around 768 millimetres of rain this month, which is by far the wettest March on record and the second wettest of any month ever in about 28 years of recorded weather statistics.\\n\\nGrowers vote to keep wheat export\\'s single desk\\nGrain growers in Victoria have formally shown their support for keeping the single desk for wheat exports.\\nAlmost 330 growers voted to retain the single desk, at the annual Victorian Farmers Federation Grains Conference.\\nGrains group president Ian Hastings says it is a strong result.\\n\"We\\'ve got a very very clear message that people want single desk and at this point in time they are not including how or who the manager will be,\" Mr Hastings said.\\n\"They want single desk marketing, which is what we\\'ve been saying all along, and at the end of the Cole inquiry is the time when we will then look at what the structure will be to ensure that we have a single-desk marketing system.\"\\nMeanwhile a better outlook for crop prospects in the US has hit domestic grain prices.\\nChicago wheat futures have dropped more than 3 per cent in the past 10 days, with rain and snow expected to help US crops.\\nLeonie O\\'Driscoll from Agfarm marketing says the fall is being felt.\\n\"Already we have seen domestic end users drop their buying values by about $10 a tonne,\" she said.\\n\\nAnalysts urge consortium to move quickly on Iraq wheat deal\\nGrains industry analysts say Australia could lose a deal to supply hundreds of tonnes of wheat to Iraq, unless it moves quickly to seal the contract.\\nMedia reports from Baghdad say the Iraqi Grains Board is refusing to agree to the deal unless it controls shipping arrangements, accusing Australia of over-inflating transport costs.\\nAnalyst Lloyd George says dealing with Iraq is not a simple process.\\n\"You know those terms and conditions can vary from customer to customer significantly and hence the risks vary with that as well,\" Mr George said.\\n\"Even in the past day or so it\\'s been talked about in the United States that Iraq is essentially looking around for another 300,000 tonnes of wheat out of the United States, which suggests they may be starting to look in other directions if business hasn\\'t been concluded.\"\\n\\nAnderson urges states to stand by water initiative\\nFormer deputy prime minister John Anderson says the National Water Initiative is in danger of stalling and the states need to recommit to it.\\nMr Anderson says the deal, to secure water for the environment and property rights for farmers, is months behind schedule and he is worried it is heading off target.\\nHe has also reject suggestions that it is time for governments to buy water from farmers for the environment.\\n\"Where they do want to enter the market in my view, they should do it as was agreed in the case of the Living Murray, as a last resort only,\" Mr Anderson said.\\n\"I\\'m glad you asked the question because I think there\\'s a few governments now and few people around the place thinking \\'oh the easy way out of this, it\\'s all too hard to find the savings\\' and I don\\'t know what\\'s wrong with modern governments, but they\\'re all so reluctant to get their hands involved with infrastructure.\"\\nMalcolm Turnbull, parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister, says only half the necessary water savings have been found for Murray River environmental flows.\\nMr Turnbull says there may be no other option than buying water and he will put the idea to a Murray Darling Ministerial Council meeting next month.\\nHe is rejecting suggestions that would lead to a big increase in water prices.\\n\"There\\'s this kind of implicit assumption that if governments are going to participate in water markets they will do so recklessly, overpaying,\" Mr Turnbull said.\\n\\nUN outlines farming\\'s threat to water\\nA new United Nations report says farming is the biggest threat to the world\\'s freshwater supply.\\nThe report has been unveiled at a World Water Forum in Mexico, and recommends an end to subsidies on pesticides and fertilisers, and realistic water pricing.\\nBut the forum has been told Australian farmers are world leaders, for using market forces to stop water wastage and pollution.\\nMike Young from CSIRO Land and Water is at the forum and says Australia is recognised as a pioneer in tackling dwindling river flows, increasing contamination and pollution and damage to fisheries.\\n\"I think we are very much at world\\'s best practice in terms of innovations,\" Mr Young said.\\n\"All of the discussions I have been involved in, people have been amazed at the approaches that Australia is taking in introducing tradeable water rights, actually moving very quickly to full cost recovery and often being there.\\n\\nN Qld cyclone damage hits prawns, avocado producers\\nFlooding is now causing havoc in Queensland between Cairns and Townsville, in the aftermath of cyclone Larry.\\nInnisfail recorded 289 millimetres of rain in the 24 hours to 9am AEST, with most coastal areas receiving more than 100 millimetres.\\nThe floods have devastated the region\\'s prawn farming industry, which supplies 40 per cent of the Australian market.\\nScott Walter from the Australian Prawn Farmers Association says there are huge losses due to flood damage and loss of power.\\n\"Basically we have power to run our freezers where the stock is kept,\" Mr Walter said.\\n\"We\\'ve got power that run aerators in our ponds, which keep the oxygen levels up to a point where the prawns are capable of basically growing and surviving, so if we lose the ability to oxygenate our ponds we\\'ll lose our crops, and if the freezers go down for too long and the seals are broken, the temperatures will drop and we\\'ll have to destroy the stock because it\\'ll no longer be safe for food.\"\\nCyclone Larry has also devastated avocado plantations on the Atherton Tablelands in far north Queensland, with losses estimated at up to $15 million.\\nJust last week the region supplied 80 per cent of the Australian crop.\\nNew South Wales grower Gordon Birch says New Zealand imports are likely to fill the shortfall, until other growing regions begin picking fruit.\\n\\nMcCain cuts hit Vic potato farmers\\nPotato growers in Victoria are facing a 10 per cent supply cut and lower prices from food processor McCain this year.\\nNegotiations on this year\\'s contracts started in the middle of last year and the federal industry and produce ombudsman has been called in to try to resolve the dispute.\\nPresident David Myers says it is unfair, when fuel costs have gone up for producers.\\n\"We want a finalisation of the contracts,\" he said.\\n\\nTelstra admits 3G upgrade will not fix all black spots\\nTelstra has begun upgrading 5,000 mobile phone towers as it prepares to roll out a new 3G phone network early next year.\\nBut there are growing concerns about whether mobile phone black spots will ever get network coverage, even with the 3G service.\\nThe technology will allow mobile phone users to access fax, email and high-speed Internet services.\\nTelstra\\'s Michael Patterson says mobile coverage will improve with 3G, but concedes there will be black sports, particularly in more isolated areas.\\n\"Absolutely but at the same time all the major communities above 350 people have mobile coverage at the moment, and we\\'re gonna be fixing some of the black spots on the highways,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re also working with both state and federal governments to see what sort of funding is available to roll out additional base stations.\"\\n\\nTas push to maintain freight subsidy\\nTasmanian farmers say they will fight to keep the state\\'s $90 million freight equalisation scheme.\\nThe Federal Government is reviewing the scheme, which subsidises the cost of freight and passengers across Bass Strait.\\nWhile Tasmania wants the scheme strengthened, parliamentary secretary for finance Richard Colebeck will only say the Government remains committed to freight equalisation of some kind,\\n\"It\\'s recognised pretty generally that the method of freighting and even operations on Bass Strait have changed significantly over the last 30 years,\" Mr Colebeck said.\\n\\nPredicted egg shortage to increase prices\\nThere are predictions of a looming national shortage of eggs, despite an oversupply and all-time low prices over the past six months.\\nThose two factors, coupled with a hot summer, have led to birds being culled in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales.\\nSteven Todd from Southern Eggs says fewer birds means fewer eggs with prices set to rise by 20 per cent.\\nHe says the bigger players are the ones who will benefit.\\n\\nBOM to consider marine weather service\\'s viability\\nThe Bureau of Meteorology is review its HF radio marine weather service.\\nThe bureau assumed responsibility for the free 24-hour service four years ago, after Telstra stopped funding it.\\nIt services vessel operators who are a long way off shore without access to satellite technology.\\nThe bureau\\'s Vernon Carr says they to find out how relevant the $3 million service is.\\n\"There are a number of alternatives available that we\\'re looking at,\" Mr Carr said.\\n\"Again technology is advancing as well and that\\'s where we\\'re looking as well is to see how far advanced, particularly for mariners in the open ocean, you know how technology is helping them receive this weather information.\\n\\nMajor supermarkets excluded from new code of conduct\\nThe fruit and vegetable industry is angry at a decision to exclude major supermarkets from a new mandatory code of conduct.\\nThe code was promised by the Federal Government in 2004 to try to give growers more clout in negotiating contracts with supermarkets.\\nBut it has now decided not to include retailers Coles and Woolworths.\\nAndrew Young from the wholesaler-backed, Central Markets Association, believes supermarkets could end up benefiting at the expense of both growers and wholesalers.\\n\"Over 50 per cent of the product will be outside the scope of the code so there\\'s really a big question mark over whether it\\'s meaningful at all, particularly given that two prior government reviews into the code issue have both recommended that if there is to be a code it should apply to the whole retail/grocery industry,\" he said.\\n\\nFood prices to soar in cyclone\\'s wake\\nFood prices could be set to soar in areas of far north Queensland devastated by cyclone Larry.\\nTrucks which transport fruit and vegetables from the region, usually backload with fresh produce and non-perishables from the state\\'s south.\\nBut with crops destroyed, the cost of carting food into the north is expected to skyrocket.\\nLes Blennerhassett from Blenners Transport says without assistance, freight costs could increase by 90 per cent.\\n\"If we can\\'t get freight subsidies from the Government our freight rates into north Queensland will double from next week, everything on the shelf\\'s going to go up,\" he said.\\n\"Every food item that\\'s on the shelf there now from fruit and veg to ice cream back to your Wheatbix, every item that\\'s on there all travels by road and rail.\\n\"Rail do have a percentage of the freight and might be able to travel a little bit cheaper going back empty but they have costs also.\"\\nMeanwhile sugar millers in north Queensland are assessing damage caused by the cyclone.\\nBundaberg Sugar\\'s Mourilyan, Babinda, South Johnstone and Tableland mills all suffered significant damage.\\n\\nGovt won\\'t allow banana imports\\nThe Federal Government says it will not relax quarantine import restrictions for bananas following the destruction of Queensland\\'s crop by cyclone Larry.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the current supply of local bananas is expected to run out within the next few days.\\nBut he says reducing biosecurity checks to import bananas to meet the shortfall would hurt Queensland growers.\\n\"We will not compromise the science to meet a short term shortage on the domestic market,\" he said.\\n\"Moreover this would be the worst thing possible for the devastated banana industry that bananas came in from overseas on a faulty or hastily decided science.\"\\nBanana growers at Carnarvon, in Western Australia, say they will not bow to pressure to send fruit to the eastern states to fill the gap.\\nWA representative on the Australian Banana Growers Council Tom Day says they will continue to supply local markets.\\n\"Whilst we sympathise with the people in the east there are are some bananas in New South Wales and there are still a few in Queensland,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve got our markets in Western Australia, that\\'s always traditionally been our market and we\\'ve got some very faithful buyers there and we want to stick with those people and help the east if we possibly can.\\nA new report raises doubts over the ability of the National Water Initiative (NWI) to solve the water crisis and deliver infrastructure reform.\\nBut it says reforming rural and urban water infrastructure could add between $6 billion and $8 billion a year to the economy.\\nOne year since conducting its first review of infrastructure policy, the Business Council of Australia (BCA) says the National Water Initiative is lacking urgency and clear direction.\\nThe BCA found of all areas reviewed like energy and transport, only water policy did not see significant progress.\\nBacking comments from former deputy prime minister John Anderson, it says the NWI is missing targets, like the creation of a national water trading market and finding more barriers than solutions.\\nThe BCA\\'s Maria Tarrant says the organisation has given the Council of Australian Governments until the end of the year to reinvigorate the National Water Initiative and further develop water trading.\\n\\nMission Australia highlights city-country divide\\nDivisions between the wealth and health of city and country dwellers are continuing to grow, according to a new report by welfare group Mission Australia.\\nThe report says rural Australians are less likely to finish school, more likely to die from alcohol abuse or be affected by domestic violence, or suffer mental illness.\\nAnne Hampshire from Mission Australia says the concerns will be taken to Canberra next week along with a push for new programs.\\n\"The report actually has three components, identify the problems which we have, identify some of the great initiatives which are happening on the ground so we make sure we can develop those further, but also we\\'ve suggested a whole suite of recommendations,\" she said.\\n\\nProbe into low Vic commodity prices\\nThe Federal Government is setting up a taskforce to investigate the impact of low commodity prices in western and north-western Victoria.\\nFarmers say low grain, wool, grape and citrus prices are crippling the economies of rural communities.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the Government will not subsidise farmers, but will try to reduce cost burdens.\\nHindmarsh mayor Darryl Argall says the taskforce will give rural communities more direct contact with the Federal Goverment.\\n\\nDairy companies compete for suppliers\\nCompetition for milk suppliers is intensifying between dairy companies in Victoria.\\nAfter years of dismal prices, milk company Fonterra is now offering a sweetener of a 50 cent per kilogram premium to new suppliers.\\nDoug Chant from the Victorian Farmers Federation is happy with the higher prices, but he is worried the incentives will not give farmers long-term financial security.\\n\\nWoodside signs big gas deal with Japan\\nOil and

year.\\n\\nBio-gas plant to put cow manure to good use\\nA feedlot and abattoir in southern New South Wales is planning to generate electricity from cow manure.\\nRockdale Beef at Yanco is developing a bio-gas plant, to make better use of 120,000 tonnes of manure produced at the feedlot every year.\\nGeneral Manager Paul Troja says the $12 million plant will be one of the first of its kind in the country.\\n\"The manure is collected and put into a digestor where the methane is extracted, the methane is cleaned then put through a gas turbine which generates electricity and hot water,\" he said.\\n\"The electricity is used in the plant and the hot water in terms of our normal requirements in an abattoir operation.\\n\\nNT flower growers meet Games shortfall after cyclone\\nCut-flower growers in the Northern Territory have had to come to the rescue of Commonwealth Games organisers, in the wake of Cyclone Larry.\\nThe red and orange tropical heliconias are a centrepiece of the bouquets presented to medal winners, and had been provided from both north Queensland and the Territory.\\nDarwin growers like Jan Hintze have had to come up with more than 10,000 blooms after the Games order doubled overnight.\\n\"I had to find another 1,000 flowers, from Monday lunchtime to Tuesday lunchtime, which is actually quite difficult,\" she said.\\n\"But however, we all got together and sure enough I did manage to get them all together and they went off on Tuesday night and they will be the bouquets today and tomorrow.\\n\\nIraq wheat sale still on track: consortium\\nThe grain consortium Wheat Australia is hosing down speculation its deal to sell wheat to Iraq is in trouble.\\nSpokesman Rhys Ainsworth says the consortium this week made its tender submission to the Iraqi Grains Board, and has already started talks with the board.\\nWhile he would not be drawn on the content of discussions, Mr Ainsworth played down the time the deal is taking.\\n\"Well it\\'s very hard to talk about what\\'s normal and what\\'s abnormal,\" he said.\\n\"I suppose, what I can confirm is that the initial offer has been made and discussions are continuing.\\n\"So that\\'s the certainly the context that Wheat Australia is proceeding with at the moment.\\n\\nMoody\\'s review pushes up AWB shares\\nShares in wheat exporter AWB have surged more than 20 cents after a positive review from ratings agency Moody\\'s.\\nThe share price has hovered at all-time lows in recent weeks but Moody\\'s assessment of subsidiary company AWB Harvest Finance has improved confidence in AWB\\'s ability to handle risk.\\nSenior financial analyst at CommSec Grant Saligari says while it is an important review, it is expected the share price will continue to fluctuate.\\n\"I think this is more a reaffirmation of short-term prospects at this stage,\" he said.\\n\"I think you\\'re going to see quite a bit of volatility until the outcome of the Cole inquiry is known and the Government\\'s response to that is known.\"\\nShares opened trading this morning at $3.97.\\nMeanwhile 220 grain growers have voiced their support for the single desk for wheat exports at a meeting in WA\\'s mid-west.\\nJust six farmers at the gathering in Morowa wanted the single desk deregulated.\\nMany believe their support is not being recognised in the eastern states but David Hayes of Badgingarra says WA growers want the single desk left alone.\\n\"I think there\\'s a clear demonstration that Western Australian farmers are 100 per cent behind single desk,\" he said.\\nThey have done the wrong thing and I think that there\\'s going to have to be some heads roll in the AWB but at the end of the day, the rank and file of the people that work for the AWB are great people and they\\'ve got our best interests at heart.\"\\n\\nSA barley growers vote to keep single desk marketing system\\nGrain growers in South Australia have voted to keep the single desk marketing system for barley.\\nA total of 5,900 barley growers were sent out the South Australian Farmers Federation\\'s barley ballot, asking growers whether they wanted to retain the single desk or complete deregulation.\\nOnly 2,000 responded.\\nThis comes after months of debate over poor barley prices which has led to some growers demanding competition for the state\\'s barley market.\\nFourteen hundred growers voted yes to the single desk, while 300 voted to remove it but one change has resulted, with 1000 growers wanting an independent single desk, with a similar structure to the Wheat Export Authority.\\n\\nFalling Aust dollar good news for farmers\\nIn some good news for farmers, the falling Australian dollar is adding hundreds of millions of dollars to export returns.\\nChief economist at Deutsche Bank Tony Meer says the dollar is at its lowest level in 18 months, trading at 71.5 US cents.\\nHe says the drop is boosting returns in the resources sector and there are also benefits for farm commodities.\\n\"Definitely anyone who gets to export, I am thinking resource companies but also the farm sector and the good news for the farm sector is that those broad acre croppers, those people who produce things like wheat and barley, at least they have got something to sell on those global markets this time around because of the breaking of the drought,\" he said.\\n\\nWool market falls off\\nA 3 per cent fall in the US exchange this week should have led to higher wool prices in Australia.\\nInstead the market has fallen off, due to poor, older wool being reoffered at sales this

areas like South-East Asia.\\nUS Wheat Associates\\' Dawn Forsythe says the proposal amounts to as much as $305 million.\\n\"Twenty-five per cent of the budget would be purchased elsewhere. Now, we have a problem with that ... with US taxpayer money going to buy competitors\\' products,\" she said.\\n\\nNZ growers question Australian fire blight detection skills\\nNew Zealand apple growers have questioned the ability of Australian quarantine workers to inspect their orchards for the plant disease fire blight.\\nInspections would be carried out as part of new regulations to allow New Zealand apple imports into Australia.\\nSubmissions on the draft regulations close next week.\\nBut Pipfruit New Zealand\\'s Peter Beaven says Australia does not have the skills to detect fire blight.\\n\"The draft contemplates AQIS inspectors coming out to New Zealand and doing work that I don\\'t think they are qualified to do, quite frankly, because you know they are going to be looking around orchards, looking for canker and so forth and they\\'ve got no experience in doing that,\" he said.\\n\\nLive export campaign to improve welfare\\nMeat and Livestock Australia will fund a million dollar campaign to raise awareness of its efforts to improve animal welfare, particularly in the live export trade.\\nThe campaign will begin in WA in a few weeks before being launched nationally, targetting consumers, metropolitan media and schools.\\nTim D\\'arcy from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association says he hopes it will make the live export industry more transparent as well.\\n\"You know, there are people out there who still don\\'t do the right thing, and we\\'re aware of that,\" he said.\\n\"And we\\'re trying to, through this process, trying to encourage everybody, to ensure their animal welfare management is of the highest order.\\n\\nDairy farmers needed for Tasmania\\nTasmania\\'s dairy industry has launched a recruitment drive to attract more farmers.\\nThe campaign has the theme \"a great place to live, a great place to dairy\", and promotes not only the sound economics of dairy farming, but the lifestyle qualities of living in Tasmania.\\nDairy consultant Basil Doonan says while there has been a big influx of New Zealand farmers in the past decade, this campaign targets Europeans.\\n\"We don\\'t mind where the investment comes from, we just need foreign investment, we need an injection of capital at the farm level in the Tasmanian industry,\" he said.\\n\\nDairy industry rallies behind FNQ producers\\nThe Queensland Dairyfarmers Organisation (QDO) has set up its own cyclone relief fund to provide help to farmers affected by cyclone Larry.\\nThe cyclone damaged infrastructure, and power is still out in many dairies five days after it hit.\\nWithout power farmers cannot milk and cows face the possibility of mastitis and going dry.\\nThere has been a major effort to fly in mobile milking machines, source generators and even fly in a tanker so milk that can\\'t be chilled can be picked up every day, otherwise it has to be poured down the drain.\\nQDO president Wes Judd says farmers across the country have offered their help and any donations will be most welcome.\\n\\nCave on standby as waters rise in Kimberley\\nResidents of stations and communities in the east Kimberley are on stand-by to evacuate as rain continues to bucket down in WA\\'s far north.\\nKununurra has had double its average March rainfall, with 200 millimetres over the past two days.\\nYesterday a helicopter arrived at nearby Ellenbrae Station to collect the Stanley family, although farmer Norm Stanley decided to stay on.\\n\"I can\\'t see anyone coming to too much grief,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve got a big hill about a kilometre over from the homestead and I\\'ll shoot across there if it gets too bad.\\n\\nTop End crabbers facing tough times\\nCommercial crabbers in the Northern Territory say the industry will be forced to downsize under major new restrictions.\\nThirty per cent fewer crabs will be able to be caught under amendments to the Territory mudcrab plan and there will be tougher penalties for breaching catch limits.\\nChris Calogerous of Sea King Seafoods is disappointed there is no provision to buy out any of the 49 commercial licence holders.\\n\"Most of us feel like we\\'ve been kicked in the guts. Our advice has been ignored and I can see how this is effectively going to put this industry under extreme pressure,\" he said.\\n\"We support all the rules relating to tougher penalties but this size limit increase of 10 mm basically means that we\\'re going to not be able to harvest crabs in the Gulf because a large proportion of the crabs there are always a smaller crab.\\n\\nFarmers sign up to save rare cocky\\nFarmers are signing up in droves for a project which offers them cash for preserving the habitat of the Commonwealth Games mascot.\\nThe Federal Government will spend more than $1 million to try to save the last 1,000 red tailed black cockatoos, found in Victoria and South Australia.\\nCockies have been seen on the farm of Richard Hobbs at Clear Lake, who says protecting trees serves a dual purpose.\\n\"We do value the trees, we think that we can crop and have trees,\" he said.\\n\"We think it increases production - protection for the livestock and probably for crops too.\\n\\nRural jobs last resort for migrants: agent\\nThere are claims today the growing social divide between city and country is making it hard to recommend rural areas to migrants.\\nAttracting migrants to regional areas has been touted as a solution to the skills shortage but migration agent Michael Walker says jobs in rural areas are often the last resort for his clients.\\nMr Walker from Absolute Immigration Services says there is often a lack of opportunities, infrastructure and support in country areas.\\n\"The infrastructure in many regional areas is not sufficient enough to sustain an influx of migration,\" he said.\\n\"We already know that many young people who have grown up in regional areas are coming into the cities seeking employment.\\n\\nFears compo payments may restrict farmers\\' borrowing\\nFarmers who receive government-funded compensation payments are being warned they could have less leverage to borrow money from banks.\\nThe issue has been highlighted in New South Wales, where compensation paid to ground water irrigators will be taxed as income.\\nBruce Brown from Namoi Catchment Management says under the tax ruling, farmers who receive compensation for the loss of any property will see their asset base reduced.\\n\"Banks would be seeing a loss of their loan security ratios which would obviously impact on the amounts of money they are prepared to lend because they will do their credit risk ratings etc on that,\" he said.\\n\\nResearch focuses on merino meat breeding\\nThe merino industry is taking a stand against competition from meat sheep breeds.\\nWhile there has been plenty of study into merino wool, less is known about the sheep itself.\\nA five year project has been researching fertility, worm resistance, muscle and fat depth in more than 10,000 stud sheep.\\nSouth Australian breeder Robin Schwartz says the industry\\'s future lies in being able to compete by offering good wool and meat characteristics.\\n\"While wool prices are up and down, and more down than up at the moment, everyone is keen to kick some goals with the meat breeding side of the operations,\" he said.\\n\\nEmerging market may help grape growers\\nAn emerging grape seed oil market could help deal with the nation\\'s oversupply of wine grapes\\nThe seeds come from a by-product of wine production and the oil is used for eating and cooking, as well as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.\\nRocco Rombola has established a grape seed oil extraction plant at Loxton in South Australia\\'s Riverland and says while it is a relatively new product in Australia, it has been used in Europe for years.\\n\\nAWB accused of reneging on wheat commitment\\nGrain traders are accusing AWB of reneging on a public commitment to relax the company\\'s power of veto over wheat exports.\\nThey say applications for hundreds of thousands of tonnes of wheat, including one from the consortium Wheat Australia, are held up at the Wheat Export Authority (WEA).\\nIt is nearly a month since Trade Minister Mark Vaile told grain growers that AWB would relax its veto power to allow other companies to export to Iraq.\\nBut applications to export more than half a million tonnes of wheat have been before the WEA for weeks, including a Wheat Australia bid to sell 350,000 tonnes to Iraq.\\nUnder current legislation, AWB must give written authority to the WEA before any export applications can be processed.\\n\"The authority must not give a bulk export consent without the prior approval in writing of AWB. I guess they\\'re still waiting for that,\" Alick Osborne from the Grain Exporters Association said.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran is confident AWB will stand by its word.\\n\"AWB has committed to the Government and to wheat growers to waive its veto power, they will honour that commitment,\" he said.\\n\\nRegional workers first to feel impact of IR changes: unions\\nUnions say regional Australia will be the first to feel the effects of the Federal Government\\'s new industrial relations laws.\\nThe changes come into force today, meaning employers have more power when negotiating contracts with workers.\\nDr Chris Briggs from the Workplace Research Centre at Sydney University believes regional workers will see major changes.\\n\"These types of laws were trialled in Victoria in the mid-90s under the Kennett government and what it found is that ... things didn\\'t change all that much in the middle of the capital cities but where they changed were in regional areas where you had three times as many low paid jobs, particularly in jobs like retail, construction and hospitality, so it is likely that regional areas will feel the effects of this,\" he said.\\nBut farmers and other regional businesses say the changes will lead to more jobs in regional Australia and greater flexibility for workers and employers.\\nOnly farms that are incorporated or in Victoria will be able to negotiate under the new laws but the National Farmers Federation (NFF) says it will be encouraging farmers to incorporate so they can access the changes.\\nThe NFF\\'s Denita Wawn says over time the new laws will lead to better relations between employers and employees.\\n\\nFarmers expecting conditions to worsen\\nConfidence in rural Australia remains weak, with more farmers expecting conditions to worsen over the next 12 months.\\nThe latest quarterly rural confidence survey from Rabobank has found only a quarter of primary producers expect the agricultural economy to improve.\\nRabobank\\'s Neil Dobbin says farmers are particularly cautious in the lead-up to the winter cropping system, with many farmers in the eastern states waiting for rain.\\n\"Across Australia the confidence was weaker. It\\'s mainly what they\\'re thinking about in the future, what they see commodity prices and input costs,\" he said.\\n\\nBeef producer set for wagyu cattle production\\nAustralia\\'s biggest beef producer is set to take over the world\\'s largest breeder of wagyu cattle.\\nWagyu beef is renowned for its marbling and is highly prized in the Japanese market.\\nThe Australian Agricultural Company has bought a bull herd belonging to Ballarat-based Westholme Wagyu, regard as the world\\'s best outside Japan.\\nManaging director Don Mackay says the company hopes to buy Westholme\\'s cows and calves, embryos and semen later this year.\\n\"You produce a higher quality beef, you produce beef products that are worth considerably more value,\" he said.\\n\"Clearly you\\'ve got a higher cost of production and the animals that we feed in our feedlot today are generally on feed for about a year but those animals are worth a lot of money.\\n\"As long as you get the right performance from the right genetics.\\n\\nTasmanian wine grapes in short supply\\nWhile the mainland deals with a massive oversupply of wine grapes, Tasmania does not have enough for this year\\'s vintage,\\nThe island state is short around 500 tonnes of grapes, mainly those used to make sparkling wines.\\nThe shortage means growers are receiving a good price for premium fruit and winemaker Andrew Pirie says there are no plans to import more fruit.\\n\"If you examine why Tasmania is now, let\\'s say isolated and good position it\\'s because we\\'ve stuck with a strong Tasmanian regional branding,\" he said.\\n\"For 20 years now we\\'ve focused on 100 per cent Tasmanian content and that now sets us apart from the south-east Australian blend which is becoming the wine that\\'s in oversupply, so regionality has been our saviour.\"\\nMeanwhile a new national task force will work to find niche global markets for Australian wine.\\nThe 13 member \"new directions\" group will also try to build stronger ties between producers and retailers, exporters and governments.\\nIt is part of a bid to reduce the wine surplus.\\nAnd in another development, one company is introducing tetra paks for wine, the same as those used for long-life milk and fruit juice.\\nAlready used in Canada, a business in Victoria\\'s Sunraysia district will become the first company in the southern hemisphere to install the technology.\\nKen Henderson from Best Bottlers says the taste of the wine will not change.\\n\"It\\'s virtually unbreakable, it can go into places where glass is not normally allowed in such as sporting venues, beaches,\" he said.\\n\\nFlooding hits northern WA town\\nA tropical low hovering over the east Kimberley has continued to dump huge falls of rain over the region.\\nWyndham received 560 millimetres over the weekend, causing major flooding and forcing road closures.\\nGraeme Down from the Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia says flooding in the lower Ord River is reportedly the biggest ever seen.\\n\"The local manager for SES here advised me that he pulled his pump up to one and a half metres above what he thought was the highest he had ever seen and his pump went under again,\" Mr Down said.\\n\"So I think there\\'s been a huge volume of water that the Water Corp was telling us, before the waters had really come down out of the diversion dam that they were letting 580 cubic metres per second.\"\\n\\nRain sets back fight against noxious weed\\nWhile pastoralists in Western Australia\\'s Pilbara region are rapt with the wet start to the year, record rainfall has resulted in a growing problem with noxious weeds.\\nMesquite is a weed with spiny thorns and covers 150,000 hectares of grazing land west of Karratha.\\nLinda Anderson from the Pilbara Mesquite Management Committee says the rain has put the fight against the weed back a number of years.\\n\"It\\'s now going to germinate a lot of the seed bank that we think that was there that we haven\\'t seen germinate in probably the last six or seven years when we haven\\'t had rain,\" she said.\\n\\nSpiralling whitefly found in Darwin backyard\\nEfforts have begun to control a new pest species found in the Northern Territory.\\nSpiralling whitefly was previously restricted to Queensland but has now been discovered in a Darwin backyard.\\nThe pest can reduce production in plants like the mango, papaya and guava but Stuart Smith from the Department of Primary Industries says it can be controlled using a natural parasite.\\n\"This is actually an extremely effective parasite,\" he said.\\n\"It is classical biocontrol in that the parasite really knocks the pest down by 80 to 90 or 95 per cent but there is just enough to survive to maintain the parasite as well as the pest populations.\\n\"But almost always in very low populations and not enough to be damaging.\"\\n\\nFarmers set to show off produce\\nPreparations are well under way for this year\\'s Sydney Royal Easter Show.\\nAnd farmers on the state\\'s far south cost are getting ready to show off their produce, including Noel Watson, from Bega.\\nHe is picking giant pumpkins and says it takes more manpower than you might think.\\n\"More than we got here. I\\'ll be bringing the tractor down here directly to pick it up, I think that one up there is probably the biggest I have grown, it could be pulling 200 kilos,\" he said.\\n\\nChinese uranium deal could prompt new mining boom\\nAustralia could be set for a new mining boom with China set to sign an agreement to explore for uranium.\\nChina is also a step closer to buying more uranium from Australia, to feed its new breed of nuclear power plants.\\nMining analyst Warren Edney, from ABN Amro, expects Chinese companies to seek joint ventures rather than stake their own claims.\\n\"They will be able to contract sales to the Chinese nuclear power generators and potentially we may even see BHP\\'s Olympic Dam selling to the Chinese,\" Mr Edney said.\\n\"I don\\'t think that we will see massive exports because there is not necessarily a lot of free uranium which is why the price has gone up for yellow cake.\\n\\nWoodside to spend billion on Vincent oil field\\nAustralia\\'s largest oil company will spend a billion dollars developing the Vincent oil field, off the coast of Exmouth, in north-western Western Australia.\\nVincent will produce about a fifth of Woodside Petroleum\\'s annual oil production by the end of 2008.\\nHartley\\'s analyst Rob Brierley says Woodside has locked in oil production from Vincent for higher than the current price of crude oil.\\n\"It\\'s a decent oil field,\" he said.\\n\"They\\'ve managed to hedge about 30 per cent of their production. Where they\\'ve got oil price locked in between $55 a barrel and $75 a barrel that\\'s pretty healthy margin stuff.\"\\n\\nRecord floods hit gulf country\\nGraziers in Queensland\\'s gulf country are still trying to assess damage caused by record floods.\\nHeavy rain from ex-tropical cyclone Larry has caused both the Leichhardt and Alexandra Rivers to burst their banks, covering up to 40 kilometres.\\nThere have also been reports of sharks spotted near a homestead, 80 kilometres inland from the Gulf of Carpentaria.\\nFurther south, Michael Crisp from Lorraine Station, says more than 250 millimetres of rain has flooded areas he never believed would go under.\\n\"Part of our farm, our irrigated farm has been really heavily damaged,\" he said.\\n\"There was up to 900 acres of corn sown and 60 or 70 acres of sorghum that had about three or four foot of water go over it and appears to be buggered altogether.\"\\nBut in sharp contrast, cattle are perishing in Queensland\\'s far south-west, because it has been so dry.\\n\\nSA dams fill for first time in decade\\nThere has been good rain across South Australia over the past few days, boosting soil moisture levels.\\nOne farmer says his dams have filled for the first time in a decade, with more than a hundred millimetres of rain falling.\\nJulian Baillie near Tumby Bay on the Eyre Peninsula says it has come as a surprise.\\n\"I sort of did a lap around earlier in the day and a lot of them which haven\\'t had any water in them for the best part of 10 years or even more some of them,\" Mr Baillie said.\\n\\nBlair attacks EU trade policies\\nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair has used an address to the Australian Parliament to attack the European Union\\'s protectionist trade policies on farm goods.\\nMr Blair says despite some gains in trade reform, a tide of protectionist sentiment is still flowing around the world.\\nThe PM has also singled out the closed trade policies of the United States and Japan, saying the future of all trade negotiations hinges on the current Doha round of talks.\\n\"If we can\\'t put a decent trade round in place, when it is so plain that our long-term national interest and the wider interest of the world demand it, this will be a failure with multiple consequences, all of them adverse,\" Mr Blair said.\\n\\nAWB pool returns up\\nTo the grains market and wheat exporter AWB has lifted its expected pool returns for the 2006-07 season by $5 a tonne.\\nIt is also expecting an increase in returns for 2004-05 because of a lower Aussie dollar.\\nThe National Party wants to set targets for ending the flow of urban waste water into the ocean and increasing the use of recycled water in both cities and rural areas.\\nThe Nationals research arm, the Page Research Centre, will conduct a study into recycled water to see if reused water could help attract and keep industries to regional centres.\\nChair of the study, Queensland Nationals president, Bruce Scott says there needs to be greater debate on community attitudes to recycled water.\\n\"What I do know is that there are so many communities that are on water restrictions almost year round now and there are communities in regional areas that are unable to attract new industries to those towns because they don\\'t have any water to offer those industries,\" Mr Scott said.\\n\\nMixed response to wool contract system\\nA new contract selling system for superfine wool has had a mixed response from producers at the first of a series of nationwide meetings.\\nUnder the plan, specific fibres would be supplied to customers through direct marketing, rather than the auction system.\\nFrank O\\'Connor, from the Australian Super Fine Wool Growers Association, says he is not confident the plan will get the support or the half million dollars it needs to get off the ground.\\n\"Not at all, but I think that\\'s the challenge ahead of us,\" Mr O\\'Connor said.\\n\\nElectronic nose could solve sheep industry woes\\nA small grey box could be the key to reducing fly strike, one of the sheep industry\\'s biggest health problems.\\nThe electronic nose is being trialed by the Sheep Cooperative Research Centre at Armidale, in New South Wales.\\nIt detects the stench of blowfly maggots in sheep near a watering point and sends a signal back to the farm\\'s computer.\\nDr Ian Colditz says, if successful, the e-nose could help the industry save more than $160 million a year.\\n\"The device works by having some electronic sensors that are picking up chemicals that are part of an odour and that creates an electrical signal that can be picked up by a computer and could be relayed to the farm office,\" Dr Colditz said.\\n\\nMilk prices increase angers WA farmers\\nWestern Australian dairy farmers are angry at milk price increases announced by dairy company Fonterra, because they say they are not enough.\\nFonterra owns the state\\'s biggest milk processor, Peter and Brownes (PB).\\nFarmers say the increase of 1.6 cents per litre, as well as an extra two cents a litre for production is too little, too late.\\nNorthcliffe farmer Alan Walker says farmers should demand a fairer price.\\n\"I would like PB suppliers to all to send a letter there, just to say how they\\'ve been treated,\" he said.\\n\"The way to look at it is if only five people send a letter over there, then we may as well get back to work because nobody\\'s worried.\\n\"But if 105 people send a letter over there, I think the Fonterra board would have to look at that quite seriously and come back and renegotiate this situation.\"\\n\\nCow excema outbreak poses threat\\nThere has been an outbreak of potentially deadly facial excema in several cow herds in eastern Victoria.\\nSunburn on teats is the first sign of the disease, which is caused by fungal toxins in damp pastures.\\nGippsland vet Jack Winterbottom says if left untreated there could be a major outbreak.\\n\"We\\'d have dead cows, at the very least you\\'d have cows that would be very hard to manage in terms of being irritable perhaps not wanting to be milked, be very reluctant to have units put on teats,\" he said.\\n\\nPork given a health lift\\nResearchers in the United States have found a new way for humans to take omega 3 oils, by eating pork or bacon.\\nWhile vitamin-enriched plant-based foods have been around for years, the researchers have now bred pigs, which produce the fatty acids normally only found in fish.\\nProfessor Randall Prather from the University of Missouri says he is confident the technology will not have the same problems as cloning procedures previously used in sheep.\\n\"Well we used the cloning procedures so the procedures are the same, and yes sometimes you do get some animals that aren\\'t perfectly normal,\" he said.\\n\"What you saw with the sheep in the UK was the first generation, and when they had offspring the offspring were normal.\\n\\nSniffer dogs to hunt cane toads\\nSniffer dogs trained to smell out cane toads will soon be introduced in north-west Australia.\\nTenders have been called by Western Australia\\'s Department of Conservation and Land Management for canine training.\\nThe department is looking for a hardy dog to withstand the tropical conditions and regional manager Gae Mckay says it will be trialed in the scrub this dry season.\\n\"Obviously it has to be a dog that\\'s trainable and in particular with the cane toads we want to make it a field ready dog, so it\\'s not just a matter of sitting sniffing luggage and so forth,\" she said.\\n\\nVaile confident of Iraq wheat deal\\nTrade Minister Mark Vaile says an important deal to sell wheat to Iraq could be completed as early as this week.\\nThe Iraqi Grains Board told reporters overnight it had signed a contract to buy 500,000 tonnes of wheat at $US190 a tonne or around $US130 million in total.\\nBut the consortium dealing with Iraq, Wheat Australia is not confirming details of the deal or that the Iraqi Grains Board has signed a contract.\\nMr Vaile says conditions are still to be sorted through, but he believes the reported figures are close to the mark.\\n\"I understand it is getting close, the negotiations are getting close to conclusion but there are still a number of issues left to be resolved,\" Mr Vaile said,\\n\"I\\'m also aware that what is being negotiated is a contract for around 500,000 tonnes of Australian wheat but not being involved at the centre of negotiations I can\\'t confirm yet that that has been concluded.\"\\nGrains market analyst Lloyd George says if the Iraq contract goes ahead, it will be a big increase on the tonnage originally proposed.\\nBut he says the price reportedly agreed to by Iraq, casts some doubt over the deal.\\n\\nWA prepares for cyclone Glenda\\nWestern Australia\\'s Pilbara region is bracing for severe winds and heavy rainfall as cyclone Glenda tracks down the coast.\\nThe cyclone has been upgraded to category five and is north of Port Hedland, with warnings of wind gusts up to 200 kilometres an hour.\\nWeather forecaster Gavin Edmonds says by late tomorrow or Friday morning cyclone Glenda will be very close to the Pilbara coast.\\n\"It is a very large system, one of the strongest cyclones we have seen off our Australian coast line,\" Mr Edmonds

stock losses.\\n\"I do hope that they do something to help a lot of people, especially people who are working in the area and a lot of the graziers,\" Mr Olive said.\\n\\nCSIRO works with grain farmers on harvest predictions\\nThe CSIRO hopes new research will give graingrowers an idea of what the season will be like six months in advance.\\nAt the moment the Bureau of Meteorology can only give a three month outlook.\\nPeter McIntosh, from Marine and Atmospheric Research in Hobart, says they are a step closer to helping farmers make more accurate decisions in the lead up to harvest.\\n\"What we\\'d really like to be able to do is to tell the farmer whether the climate conditions in the coming six months would be really good for growing or not,\" Mr McIntosh said.\\n\\nDPI finds exotic tomato virus in SE Qld\\nQueensland officials have confirmed an outbreak of an exotic virus in tomato crops near Brisbane.\\nYellow leaf curl virus has never before been found in Australia and has the potential to significantly cut production.\\nChris Adriaansen, from the Department of Primary Industries, says up to 40 small farms could be affected, but says seedling nurseries that supply growers in other parts of the state are so far clear.\\n\"Yellow leaf curl is quite a serious virus of tomatoes,\" Mr Adriaansen said.\\n\"In other parts of the world where it has attacked before it\\'s been responsible for very significant losses in some cases up to 100 per cent.\\n\\nResource industry struggles to find workers\\nMining and resource companies are starting to face staff shortages as the jobs boom in rural Australia continues.\\nA new report says the demand for good staff is making it hard to find and retain skilled workers, and it\\'s going to get worse.\\nAndrew Staite from Hudson Employment says the falling dollar and growth in China will continue to cause problems.\\n\"It is good news but is also starting to now present lots of organisations with difficulties because the difficulty in attracting skilled workers, into certainly Western Australia and Queensland, is getting greater every day.\\n\\nMining boom apparent at NT conference\\nThe boom in the resources sector has been reflected in a record turn-out at this year\\'s Northern Territory mining conference.\\nAbout 200 executives from around Australia have been learning more about potential mineral and metal discoveries in the Territory.\\nAnd most agree that companies are stepping up exploration as they look to cash in on strong commodity prices.\\n\"I\\'m Peter Robinson I\\'m a consultant I\\'m up here for URANEX, Uranium Exploration Group, people are starting to focus here a lot and the more they focus the more they find and the more they find the more they

right, that will be in the form of a buy back,\" Mr Carter said.\\n\\nResidue concerns open up Japanese hay market\\nConcern over residues found in hay exported from the United States to Japan is opening up new markets for Australian farmers.\\nThe hay exporting company Johnson Asahi wants more farmers to grow oaten hay for the Japanese market, to capitalise on Australia\\'s clean, green image.\\nSpokesman Anthony Chapman says it is not yet clear what the residues found in the US hay were.\\n\\nFlooded market makes life tough for citrus growers\\nCitrus growers say their outlook is going from bad to worse.\\nGrowers says a large crop, a flood of cheap imported juice concentrate and shrinking export markets are preventing many from selling their fruit.\\nThe summer crop is being dumped in southern New South Wales, with growers angry at an offer of $80 a tonne for their fruit.\\nFrank Battistel from Riverina Citrus says he is not confident about the future.\\n\"I know quite a few properties that have turned off water to their trees, they just can\\'t continue to lose profit every year like that and they need to make a decision to either keep going and lose money or just get out of the industry.\"\\nBut citrus growers in the west believe China could be their salvation.\\nIt has taken more than five years for the Chinese to approve Australian fruit imports, which will largely come from the eastern states.\\nWA orchardist Mark Scott says that will mean less fruit sent west.\\n\"We compete against imports from those states here in WA every day and so that the taking fruit out from their markets will mean less competition here in WA,\" Mr Scott said.\\n\\nEuropean winter hits global poppy industry\\nThe global poppy crop has shrunk, with the estimated surplus also half the size of this time last year.\\nAn exceptionally cold European winter and smaller plantings have caused the drop.\\nLindley Chopping, from the Tasmanian Poppy Growers Association, says the worldwide glut had previously equalled two and a half year\\'s supply of opiates.\\n\"It\\'s down to about one and half years supply,\" she said.\\n\\nTough times for SA potato farmers\\nSouth Australian potato growers are facing a poor harvest, with below average yields and low prices.\\nGrowers say there\\'s been an oversupply of potatoes for the past three season, and there\\'s no relief in sight.\\nGreg Rodert who grows potatoes for the fresh market in Bordertown, says the below cost of production prices have forced many growers to cut back on the amount they produce.\\n\\'We\\'re down in our plantings generally through lack of finance I suppose you might say,\" Mr Rodert said.\\n\\nJail threat for farmers employing illegal workers\\nFarmers and business operators who knowingly or recklessly employ illegal workers could go to jail under new laws announced by the Federal Government.\\nImmigration Minister Amanda Vanstone says there are around 46,000 overstayers in Australia, many working illegally to support their stay.\\nBut Senator Vanstone says only employers and labour suppliers who deliberately assist or exploit illegal workers need to fear the laws.\\nFarmers have been the target of Immigration Department raids, especially fruit and vegetable growers who often struggle to find enough seasonal labour to pick crops.\\nThe National Farmers Federation (NFF) says very few growers deliberately employ illegal workers.\\nAnd the NFF\\'s Denita Wawn says there is protection in the laws for farmers who unwittingly employ illegals.\\n\\nFuel prices set to rise\\nFuel prices are set to hit last year\\'s record highs.\\nThe price of both petrol and diesel is up in many parts of the country, blamed on the rising price of crude oil and the falling value of the dollar.\\nBut Geoff Trotter from Fuel Track says traditionally fuel prices are at their highest at Easter and it is not good news this year.\\n\\nGlenda heads toward Pilbara coast\\nWestern Australian mining communities are on red alert as tropical cyclone Glenda approaches the Pilbara coast.\\nThe industry has come to a standstill as it prepares for gale force winds and possible

to ride out the cyclone,\" he said.\\n\\nCyclone recovery expected to take months\\nIn far north Queensland and the Gulf country, communities are still trying to come to terms with the impact of cyclone Larry.\\nThe community has donated $10 million to help but the recovery will take months, if not years.\\nCyclone Larry is said to have cost 4,000 jobs, many of them on farms and there is a concern young people will exodus the region in search of work.\\nAgForce has expressed concerns that flood affected graziers may not be able to access assistance if it is means-tested because of the increase in property valuations.\\nThe Bundaberg Sugar Company will not open its Mourilyan mill south of Innisfail for this year\\'s cane crush, saying Larry has drastically reduced the harvest forecasts.\\nCane will be diverted to other mills and farmers calling for assistance to remove trees and debris from the orchard have been told by cyclone recovery task force coordinator General Peter

staff.\\nResearch by the Australian Rural and Remote Workforce Agencies shows doctors, vets and teachers are increasingly choosing to work part-time.\\nAlmost 40 per cent of country GPs work half a full-time shift.\\nBut spokeswoman Martina Stanley says it can be a positive in attracting professionals to country areas.\\n\"We\\'re trying to achieve a system whereby we can support them so that they don\\'t have to work the way that doctors did once upon a time,\" she said.\\n\"The impact is felt more significantly in rural areas because traditionally rural doctors have worked longer hours on average than metropolitan doctors.\\nThe Nationals want more safeguards to protect the diversity of regional news services before they will support media ownership changes.\\nThe Federal Government wants to let media owners operate across radio, television and print, leading to fears of consolidation in rural areas.\\nBut Nationals leader Mark Vaile says businesses must be protected from

reached a price agreement with food processor McCain.\\nThe company had been offering lower prices, which farmers said would make the industry unviable.\\nThe McCain Growers Group says neither farmers nor the company are happy with the deal because there was compromise on both sides.\\nChief executive Tony Pitt says growers have accepted $2.75 a tonne less than last year\\'s price.\\n\"There is a price now that will operate now for 2006 deliveries and also for 2007 and that price will be $227.25,\" he said.\\n\\nPotato growers to maintain crop production\\nTasmanian potato growers have welcomed new crop contracts from the processor, Simplot and now expect to maintain crop production at recent levels.\\nLast year Simplot told growers there would be price and volume cuts when McDonald\\'s awarded a major french fry contract to New Zealand growers.\\nBut Dennis Leonard from the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association says the situation has improved.\\n\"Simplot got on their front foot and went out and chased down some new markets, which has been of benefit to a lot of growers in the State,\" he said.\\n\\nHighway upgrade to improve flood prone section\\nThe Federal Government has announced plans to improve road train access between central Australia and Queensland.\\nA $2 million upgrade will improve a flood prone section of the Plenty Highway, which links Alice

needed.\\n\"Any improvement that they do to that road is a big help,\" he said.\\n\"I can give you an instance here, six decks coming down the other day, we could not get over 30 kilometres an hour.\\n\\nLevy to pay for rail upgrade angers grain growers\\nFarmers on South Australia\\'s Eyre Peninsula are angry at a proposed grain levy to pay for a regional rail upgrade.\\nUp to $40 million will be spent upgrading road and rail, and farmers are being asked to contribute $2 million.\\nThe Regional Development Board says dollar-for-dollar federal funding could be jeopardised if farmers do not support the 50 cent per tonne levy.\\nWhile there has been some support, most attending a grain grower forum at Cummins objected to it.\\n\"I just think we\\'re being conned,\" one farmer said.\\n\"The buck stops at the farmer\\'s gate and we\\'re regarded as a bit of a cash cow.\\n\"Everytime they want money they seem to think \\'oh well we\\'ll just whack a levy on for a

professor in meteorology at Flinders University, Peter Schwedtferger, says grape growers need to minimise irrigation in the Barossa Valley.\\nHe says saline water is being piped from local reservoirs, which is already causing problems.\\n\"If the Barossa is over irrigated with this relatively saline water that\\'s currently being used, the Barossa\\'s life is going to be limited,\" he said.\\n\"Once the really serious saline infestation occurs it\\'s going to be too late.\"\\nBut one of the Barossa\\'s biggest grape growers, Ed Schild, says salinity is not a problem and estimates only half a hectare is affected by salt.\\n\\nCattle station sells for nearly $40m\\nA Kimberley cattle station has sold in what is believed to be one of the region\\'s biggest sales.\\nA WA

millions\\nThe Grains Council says making radical changes to the wheat export system before this season\\'s harvest could cost the industry half a billion dollars.\\nAhead of releasing a blueprint on the future of the single desk next week, the Grains Council says it will be calling for AWB to retain control of selling this season\\'s harvest.\\nThe council\\'s David Ginns says despite the obvious concerns over AWB, it is still the best company to manage Australia\\'s wheat exports in the near term.\\n\"It\\'s not just something you can say \\'ok let\\'s make a change tomorrow\\',\" he said.\\nThe council says AWB and other traders have invested millions of dollars based on AWB\\'s control of the pool and any sudden change will hurt growers.\\nMr Ginns has also angrily rejected a report suggesting growers want this year\\'s harvest underwritten to the tune of a billion dollars by the Federal Government.\\n\\nUS reaches agreement with Japan to reopen beef market\\nUS Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials says they have reached an agreement with Japan on steps to reopen that country\\'s beef market.\\nImports of US beef were suspended in January after a shipment of veal was found to include bone material prohibited by the Japanese.\\nUSDA acting under-secretary Chuck Lambert told a Senate panel his team has answered Tokyo\\'s remaining questions about January\\'s foul-up at a New York veal plant and set in motion steps to resume beef trade, starting with a plant safety checklist.\\n\"Once that takes place, we will have people in the plants and do those verification audits, just as fast as we can,\" he said.\\n\"That probably will take in the neighbourhood of a week to 10 days, to two weeks.\\n\"And then, the next challenge will be to get the auditings from Japan in, to do the verification visits.\"\\nAnd Mr Lambert says Tokyo has agreed to do outreach with Japanese consumers to outline the changes and reassure them of the safety of US beef - a significant turnaround if true.\\nMeanwhile beef from the United States is being sold at a 20 per cent discount into Australia\\'s fourth biggest market, Taiwan.\\nMeat and Livestock Australia (MLA) says beef sales from Australia are not being affected and does not think the Americans are likely to try the same tactic in the much bigger Japanese market.\\nTim Kelf from MLA says food quality and safety are likely to be the issues in Japan, not the price.\\n\"The retailers are being very cautious about just jumping back into American product, the Japanese are not going to rush back to American product,\" he said.\\n\"I wouldn\\'t necessarily have agreed with that 12 months ago but I think that this time the Japanese consumer from my previous experience many years ago are fairly twitchy.\\n\\nGovt clears way for Snowy Hydro sale\\nThere has been heated debate in Federal Parliament, with the Government clearing the way to sell its 13 per cent share of the Snowy Hydro Electricity Scheme.\\nThe Government and Opposition support the sale but the Nationals\\' Kay Hull and independents oppose it, saying privatisation could harm irrigator water entitlements and environmental flows.\\nMember for New England Tony Windsor says the Government has rushed through the sale motion without enough public consultation.\\n\"There are so many unknowns in terms of the

It\\'s only an added cost of $180 per staff member that needs to go airside.\"\\n\\nFruit exports to Taiwan set to resume\\nThe Federal Government says table grape and citrus exports to Taiwan are set to resume.\\nThe trade was halted at the start of the year because of Taiwanese concerns about Queensland fruit fly.\\n\\nGrowers reject latest NZ apple bid\\nApple and pear growers have rejected New Zealand\\'s latest bid to export apples to Australia.\\nSubmissions closed yesterday on a new draft risk import analysis which would allow New Zealand apples into the country.\\nBut growers like Tom Quirke from Loxton, in South Australia, say the risk of the disease fireblight is still too great.\\n\"The last thing we need is to have something further to cause an industry to become unviable and that\\'s exactly what would happen if New Zealand apples arrived in Australia,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s not if we got fire blight but when we get fire blight. It\\'s too much of a risk.

about loss of single desk for wheat exports\\nFarmers have been warned that grain prices could drop dramatically if AWB loses control of the single desk for wheat exports.\\nAWB International director Clinton Starr told a meeting of graingrowers at Murtoa in Victoria last night, that the company has secured a $13 per tonne premium each year through the single desk.\\nHe says farmers should be very concerned about any plans to change the single desk after the Cole inquiry and AWB\\'s experience in managing the system is as valuable to growers, as the single desk itself.\\n\"I don\\'t say that that is the only structure that can deliver that,\" he said.\\n\"But what I would say is that if you change it you have to be very careful when you change or you effect change because in fact a lot of

central Australian cattle heading west.\\n\"They\\'re experiencing a very, very good season over there and I think it\\'s given the Pilbara and all that Western Australia, the Gascoyne and all that a very good drink,\" he said.\\n\"And because of their flush of the season over there, they sometimes come over here and get a bit excited and buy a few cows and calves.\"\\nBut agents in the west

circumstances surrounding that,\" he said.\\n\\nBrazil beef exports no threat to Australian markets: producer\\nThere are claims today that Australia will not have to compete with the world\\'s biggest beef exporting country in our key markets for at least a decade.\\nBeef producer Chris Ward has been working in Brazil for 20 years and says the country is struggling to increase its 174 million head herd due to a poor currency, lack of infrastructure and low commodity prices.\\nMr Ward says the major inhibitor is the presence of foot and mouth disease, which will continue to lock Brazil out of Australia\\'s major markets of Japan, Korea and the US.\\n\"In terms of competing with Australia in the premium market that Australia plays in, I don\\'t see that,\" he said.\\n\\nResources industry staffing problems expected to worsen\\nFinding and retaining staff is one of the biggest issues facing Australia\\'s booming resources industry, according to a new study.\\nThe People at Work report, published by the Chamber of Minerals and Energy, says the issue is only going to get worse.\\nAuthor Bernard Salt says the problem in hanging onto staff has a lot to do with different values between the generations.\\n\"We have always assumed that we\\'re the best country in the world and everyone will automatically want to come to Australia to work,\" he said.\\n\\nPastoralists expect to double cattle production\\nNorthern Territory pastoralists expect to increase cattle production by 50 per cent within the next 10 years, according to the first comprehensive survey since the early 1980s.\\nBetter fencing and water points in central Australia, and improved pasture in the north would result in the increased carrying capacity\\nPastoral extension officer Trudi Oxley says improved weaning rates also mean more production.\\n\"We came up with a weaning percentage across the NT as being 71 per cent, so for every hundred cows there were 71 weaners pulled off them when they were mustered and a mortality rate around 3 per cent,\" she said.\\n\\nLeather business suffers from impact of drought, cyclone\\nA leather tanning business in south-east Queensland has been dealt a double blow.\\nMurgon Leather has been forced to impose water restrictions due to the drought, while its main supplier of hides closed in the wake of cyclone Larry.\\nThe Innisfail Meatworks will remain shut until the end of the month.\\nGeneral manager James Barbeler says the leather tanning business has been forced to cut back on staff and production.\\n\\nSheep\\'s temperament has impact on reproductive rate\\n\\'Crazy\\' sheep are more than just a nuisance in the yards - research has found they are are also less fertile and less productive.\\nDr Alex Ball of Sheep Genetics Australia is looking at the impact of temperament in trials on his property at Armidale in New South Wales and elsewhere across Australia.\\nHe says a nervous temperament can have an impact on how well sheep reproduce.\\n\"We have just been basically tagging animals be they crazy or calm and what it has had is impacts on reproductive rate,\" he said.\\n\"So we know our own crazy ewes they are probably rearing 20 to 30 per cent less lambs and that\\'s mirrored by some very good research in Western Australia.\\n\\nVictorian takes out young auctioneers award\\nA 24-year-old Victorian auctioneer has won the National Young Auctioneers Championship.\\nAdam Mountjoy from Mansfield in Victoria\\'s Alpine region received the highest score after being judged on diction, presentation and manner during a sale of four steers at the Sydney Royal Easter Show.\\nHe says it is very rewarding after working so hard to prepare for the competition.\\n\"Just going through previous videos and competitions that have been held and I guess analysing and picking out the good points and some of the better things to do or try, and do on the day,\" he said.\\n\\nFarming grants to aid environmental projects\\nThe Federal Government wants to give farmers cash incentives to encourage them to carry out environmental improvements on their land.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran has set a deadline of 2008 to implement the scheme, which he says will improve the environment and lift farm productivity.\\nMr McGauran will not say how much the plan will cost but says the National Farmers Federation\\'s call for a billion dollars in compensation is well off the mark.\\n\"No where near in the ball park but before we lock ourselves into positions why don\\'t we find a way forward,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ll fund some pilot projects and I\\'m glad to say the states are showing some interest and a number are showing strong support.\\n\"If we work cooperatively we\\'ll find a way to strike the balance between conservation or environment and production.\"\\nThe NFF has welcomed the announcement, and says the scheme should not be viewed as a cash handout or production subsidy.\\nPresident Peter Corish says farmers manage 60 per cent of Australia\\'s land and deserve to be rewarded for their environmental works.\\n\"Farmers are asked to manage that native vegetation at their own cost and we believe firmly if the community wants to maintain that native vegetation, certainly that farmer should be rewarded for managing that,\" he said.\\n\\nCourt postpones decision on AWB \\'apology\\' document\\nA decision on whether AWB\\'s so-called \\'apology\\' document should be made public has been postponed until late April.\\nThis morning the Federal Court ruled it would allow further evidence from AWB supporting its claim of legal professional privilege.\\nThe document was initially provided to the Cole inquiry along with other evidence prepared by AWB company secretary Dr Richard Fuller.\\nA draft apology, it was written by former managing director Andrew Lindberg, after a US-based public relations specialist advised AWB to over-apologise, to try to counter any corporate scandal relating to the oil-for-food program.\\nAt this morning\\'s hearing, the Federal Court heard AWB would provide a second witness statement testifying the apology was prepared as part of lawyer-client meetings and as such should remain confidential.\\nAWB also questioned the power of Commissioner Terence Cole to make any rulings around lawyer-client confidentiality, an issue disputed by lawyers acting on behalf of the commission.\\nA full hearing has been adjourned until April 24.\\nMeanwhile another two senior staff members have resigned from AWB.\\n\\nYellow leaf curl virus outbreak hits tomato growing region\\nThere has been a confirmed outbreak of the tomato yellow leaf curl virus in one of Australia\\'s major tomato growing regions.\\nPlant biosecurity officers are in Bundaberg in south-east Queensland to increase surveillance and identify the spread of the virus, discovered in a backyard garden.\\nThe disease was only recently detected in Australia, near Brisbane and can stunt plant growth and slash production.\\nHydroponic grower David Da Tra says growers need to keep the virus carrier at bay.\\n\"Just hoping we can control or minimise the vector which is the silverleaf greenhouse,\" he said.\\n\\nHorticulture industry suppliers on notice to cut costs\\nSuppliers of materials, machinery and other goods to the horticulture sector have been placed on notice to cut costs to growers.\\nFruit and vegetable growers have launched a class action against cardboard box maker, Amcor, seeking up to $300 million compensation over alleged price fixing on packaging.\\nThey claim 17,000 growers and some major food manufacturers were overcharged more than $700 million for boxes and pallets.\\nMike Badcock from grower group Ausveg says growers are now looking at costs across the sector.\\n\"It seems quite suspicious doesn\\'t it. America, the fuel price is only half what we pay in Australia, to put a pivot irrigator up in America, it costs you between a third and half what it costs to put one up in Australia, fertiliser is a lot cheaper in new Zealand,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve really got to get to the bottom of a lot of these things in Australia and find out why it\\'s costing us more to farm in Australia.\"\\nDespite claims farmers are losing bargaining power, a new report says selling produce under contract does not place growers at the mercy of big business.\\nThe report, commissioned by the Australian Farm Institute, says there has been substantial growth in the level of farm produce sold on the contract system and prices are not necessarily falling.\\nReport author Mark Barber says it depends on the farmer.\\n\"It opens up all sorts of new opportunities and some farmers will benefit more than others from this,\" he said.\\n\\nRiverland citrus growers locked out of Indonesian trade\\nCitrus growers in South Australia\\'s Riverland have been locked out of selling fruit to Indonesia despite being free of fruit fly.\\nAustralia\\'s $35 million fruit and vegetable trade with Indonesia is at a standstill because of new import protocols designed to address fruit fly concerns.\\nThe Riverland\\'s fruit fly-free status is recognised by other Asian markets like Japan and Taiwan but not by Indonesia\\'s newly imposed quarantine protocols.\\nJudith Damiani from Australian Citrus Growers says it is an important market.\\n\"It\\'s not one of our largest markets in terms of volume or value but we do send quite a significant amount of mandarins and valencias as well,\" she said.\\n\\nDairy Farmers restructure goes ahead despite profit\\nDespite posting a half-year profit of $4.7 million, the Dairy Farmers Co-operative will push on with a restructure involving the closure of four plants.\\nThe Bomaderry factory, in the south-east of New South Wales, shuts down today, while the Toowoomba plant, in southern Queensland, will close by the end of this month with the loss of 12 full and part-time jobs.\\nChief executive Rob Gordon says changes across the business are expected to save $42 million a year.\\n\\nLocusts swarm across WA wheatbelt\\nLocust plagues are emerging as a big concern for winter crops in Western Australia this season.\\nLocusts have made their way from the wet pastoral regions into agricultural areas, with farmers now reporting locusts swarms across the wheatbelt.\\nSenior entomologist with the Department of Agriculture Kevin Walden says the green feed in the agricultural regions could help locusts survive for weeks.\\n\"We\\'re likely to see these locusts surviving into May but by the time the females are completing their cycle, then numbers will drop off very quickly,\" he said.\\n\"But, as I said, if the break of the season\\'s early, then there may be a bit of an overlap between crops emerging and locusts still flying around.\\n\\nArid zone research group research to focus on desert areas\\nPastoralists and researchers from around the country have taken the first step towards creating a new arid zone research group.\\nThe group will work independently of state and territory organisations, focusing on problems that affect pastoral production in all desert areas.\\nMark Ashley from the 21st Century Pastoral Program says initial research will focus on reducing input costs and improving technology for the wool and beef industries.\\n\"As it stands at the moment most of the state agencies are focused with their particular industry,\" he said.\\n\"A lot of these issues are big issues, they go across state boundaries.\\n\\nWeather blamed for hike in fish prices\\nFish prices in Melbourne have jumped by up to 20 per cent in the lead-up to Easter.\\nAn unusually high number of low pressure systems with high winds have kept many small fishing boats off the water.\\nRoss McGowan from Seafood Industry Victoria says the smaller boats catch most of the fish bought by restaurants and which are also popular at Easter.\\n\"They generally catch the fish that end up in restaurants and the Victoria market for example,\" he said.\\n\"Whiting, flathead, mullet, the whole range of snapper of course.\\n\"They\\'re the sorts of fish the bay and inlet fishermen catch, including calamari.\\n\\nPasture shortage limits cattle feedlot expansion\\nA shortage of pasture in some provinces of Indonesia is limiting the expansion of small community cattle feedlots.\\nRather than feed grain, villagers rely on leucaena, legumes, kapok and even banana stems and leaves.\\nIt can take up to 12 months to fatten cattle in this way for the lucrative Jakarta market.\\nResearcher Maximilian Kapa says one feedlot can support up to 15 remote families in West Timor.\\n\"It is a very good market, especially the Jakarta market,\" he said.\\n\"Actually the farmers here cannot fulfil the market demand because there is a trend that the population of Bali cattle declines here every year due to uncontrolled breeding and minimised management like that.\\n\\nI didn\\'t see rorts cables: Howard\\nPrime Minister John Howard has told the Cole inquiry he does not believe he received or read any cables that warned AWB was involved in sanctions-busting.\\nMr Howard was under tight security when he arrived at the commission to explain when he first knew about AWB\\'s improper payments to the Iraqi regime.\\nBlocked-off streets, bag searches and sniffer dogs greeted those who entered court two on level five of the building ahead of the Prime Minister\\'s long-awaited appearance at the Cole inquiry.\\nThe Prime Minister spent a brisk 42 minutes in the witness box.\\nWhen senior counsel assisting, John Agius, asked him to put a date on his knowledge that the Iraqis were rorting the oil-for-food program, Mr Howard said it was probably a year before a speech he gave on Iraq to the National Press Club in March, 2003.\\nWhen asked if he knew AWB was involved in that rorting, Mr Howard replied: \"No, I didn\\'t. I had always believed the best of that company. It would never have crossed my mind it would have behaved corruptly.\"\\nCommissioner Cole refused any cross-examination of the Prime Minister, saying it was outside the terms of reference. \\n\\nPetition\\nMeanwhile a petition supported by some of the leading lights in the legal profession is calling for a widening of the inquiry\\'s terms of reference.\\nLawyers, barristers and academics from the University of New South Wales say AWB and the Federal Government may have violated international law by allowing bribes to be paid to Saddam Hussein.\\nPetition leader Ben Sawell says it is now clear the powers of the Cole inquiry are too narrow.\\n\"There is a great deal of concern in the legal profession about the conduct of the Australian Government in all of this business of the oil-for-food scandal,\" he said.\\n\\nWine grapes dumped as oversupply woes hit growers\\nTens of thousands of tonnes of Riverland wine grapes will be dumped on the ground or left to rot on the vine this season because of the national oversupply.\\nThe South Australian growers have been left with no market for their fruit after some had contracts suspended, while others were not able to renew their agreements with wineries.\\nThe region\\'s lost income could total $65 million.\\nLoxton grower Glenn Arnold says the situation is desperate.\\n\"We\\'re just trying to survive,\" he said.\\n\"Everybody says there\\'s swings and roundabout and you know good times are followed by bad times, bad times are usually followed by good times ... we\\'ve just got to hang in there.\\n\\nWA wine producer secures large UK contract\\nPalandri wines of Margaret River in Western Australia has just secured the state\\'s single largest export ever into the United Kingdom.\\nEighty thousand cases will go to 1,800 British supermarkets.\\nPalandri\\'s Gordon Grant says WA is being recognised as producing a unique, quality wine for under $24.\\nHe says the contract is significant for bulk producers of generic wines.\\n\"It\\'s really starting to gain ground, the buyers in particular are staring to see Western Australia as something very different to the other material they have got on their shelves,\" he said.\\n\\nFarmers environmental grant \\'pork barrelling\\'\\nThe Federal Government\\'s plan to pay farmers to better manage the land has been labelled a \"veiled production subsidy\" and a \"pork barrel\" by a Canberra think tank.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran wants to give farmers cash payments to better protect the land and lift their productivity.\\nHe believes farmers are carrying an unfair share of the costs of managing the environment and should be rewarded for carrying out projects which benefit the entire community.\\nBut the Australia Institute\\'s Andrew Macintosh says the Government has a poor record of delivering environmental projects and in allocating funding to regional areas.\\n\"What we\\'ve seen with the Natural Heritage Trust is that the program\\'s turned into a massive pork barrel that\\'s dressed up in green clothing and that\\'s my big fear with this,\" he said.\\nMr McGauran says the program will not become a spending black hole and denies the proposed payments would become production subsidies.\\n\\nPaying more for early child care an option, says association\\nRegional Australia is having to think creatively to overcome shortages of childcare places and funding.\\nCost and access are still big problems for many farming families who now rely on a second income to make ends meet.\\nLynne Wannon, from the National Association of Community-based Childcare Services, says both parents and governments need to consider paying more for early childhood care.\\n\"There are different models around, there are mobile services where they have outreach programs,\" she said.\\n\"A van will go out into a farm community and children can come there but they might only get one day a fortnight of a program.\\n\\nEaster gifts may post disease risk: AQIS\\nThe Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) is warning that Easter gifts from overseas, such as painted or blown eggs, could spread bird flu to humans and birds.\\nCarson Creagh from AQIS says the service will seize hundreds of \"at risk\" items this weekend including eggs, feathers and nests made of dried grapevines, and straw.\\nHe says many come from Eastern Europe or the Mediterranean and could introduce bird flu, Newcastle disease or other viruses capable of devastating Australia\\'s poultry industry.\\n\"The obvious one is avian influenza which can be transmitted on eggs,\" he said.\\n\\nCroc captured in Katherine main street\\nWhile the floodwaters are subsiding in the Northern Territory, it is taking longer to remove the visiting wildlife.\\nLast night, a metre-long freshwater crocodile was captured in the main street of Katherine\\nAnd at Mataranka Homestead, a hundred kilometres south, Deborah Moore says her place has become an ark.\\n\"There\\'s lots of kangaroos and peacocks and snakes and quite a few crocodiles around as well,\" she said.\\n\\nPriority scheme in place for dwindling Q fever vaccine supplies\\nMeatworkers will be given priority access to the last remaining doses of Q fever vaccine to protect against the debilitating disease that is spread to human through contact with infected feral and domestic livestock.\\nThis year\\'s demand for the vaccine is expected to exceed current supplies, and fresh stocks cannot be produced until a new lab opens early next year.\\nDr Rachel David, from CSL Pharmaceuticals, the only company in the world that makes Q Vax, has now set up a scheme to reduce the impact of the looming shortage.\\n\"We\\'ve put in place a prioritisation system so that people involved directly in meat processing will be able to contact CSL and get access to the vaccine as a priority,\" she said.\\n\\nAbattoirs given green light for halal beef exports to Malaysia\\nThree Australian abattoirs, one in Queensland and two in Victoria, have been given approval to send halal beef back into the Malaysian market.\\nLast August, Malaysia suspended beef imports from Australia due to concerns that slaughter methods do not meet Islamic standards.\\nThe general manager of Norvic Foods, Jon Hayes, says approval was received to resume beef exports from the company\\'s Wodonga abattoir after religious and technical auditors inspected the site.\\n\"Malaysia is only taking a very small percentage of the Australian beef and it\\'s another market that Australia needs,\" he said.\\n\"We can\\'t consume what we produce for 20 million people and we need the total global scene, and Malaysia is a very important market.\"\\n\\nShareholders vote not to rebuild Norply factory\\nThe Kyogle community, on the New South Wales north coast, has had its worst fears confirmed with Norply Timbers deciding not to rebuild its factory after a fire last year.\\nUp until last September\\'s devastating fire, the Norply factory employed about 140 people, making it one of the most significant employers in a town with a population of 4,000.\\nThere were hopes that the company would eventually rebuild on its existing site but those have now been dashed.\\nNorply\\'s 30 shareholders met earlier this week, when a majority voted to declare a dividend rather than rebuild the mill.\\n\\nLittle central Aust critter becoming a popular pet\\nIt might not be the Easter bunny but a little critter from central Australia is proving a hit in the Top End.\\nThe spinifex hopping mouse has become a popular pet in Katherine.\\nAnd as vet Sam McMahon explains, you cannot cuddle them, but with their big eyes, kangaroo legs, and basil brush tail, they are great to watch.\\n\"They\\'re a very interesting pet, they can live quite happily in you know a reasonable sort of set up,\" he said.\\n\"And they\\'re very interesting to watch. They dig holes, they dig tunnels, they bound around, they\\'re quite interesting to sort of sit there and stare at.\\n\\nGovt calls for Q fever vaccine tenders\\nThe Federal Government has called for tenders to produce Q fever vaccine as supplies of the drug reach critically low levels.\\nQ fever is a debilitating disease which mainly affects meat and livestock workers, and is transmitted through infected animals.\\nThough the tender process should be completed by next month, the Government says it is unlikely a new supplier will be found in time to prevent a vaccine shortage.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran has criticised CSL for ending production and bulldozing the vaccine plant.\\n\"The Government has called for expressions of interest for a tender to produce long term supplies of Q [fever] vaccine, it may well be that CSL will be a tenderer but there may be other companies as well,\" he said.\\n\\nKey witness to front Cole inquiry\\nThe Cole inquiry examining AWB\\'s role in the oil-for-food scandal has been adjourned to a date to be fixed after hearing evidence last week from John Howard, Alexander Downer and Mark Vaile.\\nBut there is at least one key witness still to come.\\nWith public hearings all but finalised before Easter, senior counsel assisting John Agius informed Commissioner Terence Cole he would require him to sit again for several days after Anzac Day.\\nMr Agius told the inquiry he was making arrangements for a witness to appear before the commission.\\nHe later confirmed that witness to be Felicity Johnston, who worked for the UN\\'s Office of Iraq program.\\nMr Agius says the commission has obtained clearance from the United Nations but is still going through necessary protocols with the British Foreign Office.\\n\\nExtreme weather events affecting rural commodities outlook\\nCyclones and hurricanes continue to affect the outlook for rural commodities across mining, wheat and sugar markets.\\nThe latest Commodity Price Index from the National Australia Bank is predicting a slight easing in rural prices over the next two years, with sugar, beef, wheat and cotton all expected to perform well.\\nAgribusiness economist Skye Dixon says extreme weather events have a big affect on rural prices.\\n\"They do certainly have an impact because so much of rural commodity prices is derived from what\\'s happening with supply,\" she said.\\n\\nNSW drought worsens\\nNew South Wales is slipping further back into drought, with 46 per cent of the State now drought declared.\\nThat is up eight percentage points on last month.\\nOnly 20 per cent New South Wales is considered satisfactory for rainfall.\\nBut the State\\'s Primary Industries Minister, Ian Macdonald, says despite worsening conditions, farmers are optimistic about a bigger winter crop than last year.\\n\"The State needs widespread rain particularly in the north but also many areas in the south-west which are major cropping regions need a good downpour fairly quickly,\" he said.\\n\\nTomato plant virus spreading\\nThere is confirmation today that the tomato yellow leaf curl virus is spreading in one of Australia\\'s major production areas.\\nThe virus stunts tomato growth and drastically limits yields.\\nDiscovered for the first time in Australia a couple of weeks ago in Brisbane, it has now been identified on two commercial properties near Bundaberg.\\nInspections are being planned in other Queensland tomato growing regions.\\nChris Adriaansen from the Department of Primary Industries says it is proving difficult to trace the origin of the virus.\\n\"This is what we\\'re finding as we\\'re going through all the properties that we\\'re getting positive diagnosis on - there\\'s no common linkage in terms they\\'re not using the same supply of seedlings, they\\'re not using the same supplier of anything, there\\'s no other linkage,\" he said.\\n\\nProtesters vow to continue gold mine protest\\nEnvironmentalists are continuing to picket a New South Wales gold mine over the use of cyanide, which they claim will permanently poison the local water supply.\\nThe Lake Cowal open pit mine, in the state\\'s central west, began processing recently but operations were shut down yesterday and a delivery of cyanide has reportedly been delayed.\\nEight protesters have been charged with trespassing but Graham Dunstan from Cyanide Watch says the protest will continue until the mine is closed.\\n\"This mining company has been granted water leases by the NSW Government to pump up 3,650 megalitres a year for this cyanide operation,\" he said.\\n\"They leave this water behind permanently poisoned. Now in a time of drought giving people the equivalent of a Dubbo\\'s water supply each year is profligate.\"\\n\\nSearch for grapevine genome moves a step closer\\nAn Italian team of scientists has produced the world\\'s first draft of the grapevine genome sequence.\\nThe work, on the pinot noir variety, could lead to the development of high yielding, disease resistant grapes that still make good tasting wine.\\nProject leader with CSIRO Plant Industries, Doctor Mark Thomas, has been in close contact with the Italian team and says it is an important step towards the final grapevine gene map.\\n\"Once the genome sequence is completed it will be the foundation I think for 21st century grape research as it will allow us to understand what genes are involved in grape quality and those genes that also control fruitfulness and yield,\" he said.\\nIn Australia, the CSIRO has been working with a group in France trying to isolate the genes responsible for powdery mildew resistance and downey mildew resistance.\\n\\nGrowers satisfied with grape prices\\nRiverland grape growers who supply to wine giant McGuigan Simeon say they are satisfied with the fruit prices determined by an independent analyst.\\nThe analyst was called in after a dispute arose over prices for grapes, many which had already been delivered to the winery.\\nChris Byrne, from the Riverland Wine Grape Growers Association, says growers had been expecting to receive the lowest price.\\n\\nFloodwaters affect search for banana prawns\\nFloodwaters and muddy river sediments are making it hard for trawlers in the Gulf of Carpentaria this season.\\nThe banana prawn harvest began on Saturday, across the northern fishery.\\nNewfishing Australia\\'s Steven Valentine says the fleet is being forced to use depth sounders to find the prawns.\\n\"With the water clarity not being as it is - not very good, due to the mud slick - and we can\\'t spot the mud boils, boats are having to rely heavily on their sounders, which means we don\\'t cover the area quite so efficiently,\" he said.\\n\"So it\\'s been a pretty slow start to the season.\\n\"Traditionally we road freight them out of Karumba. But, at the moment, with all the roads closed, we haven\\'t got anywhere to send them to.\\n\"Hopefully within the next four to five days, the rivers will drop enough so that the roads will be open and we can truck prawns out.\"\\nThe Newfishing Australia fleet is hoping to catch up to 60 tonnes of banana prawns per trawler this season.\\n\\nBureaucracy to blame for closure, scallop fisher says\\nTasmanian scallop fishers say they are fed up with a bureaucracy that has locked them out of the Bass Strait scallop fishery for the past six years.\\nNow the Federal Government says the fishery will remain closed for another three years.\\nScallop fisherman Peter Stegmann says scientific advice showed a limited season was viable and blames overlapping Commonwealth and state fishing jurisdictions for the problem.\\nHe says part of the $220 million earmarked for industry restructure should be spent sorting out the mess.\\n\\nStudy to focus on abalone habitat\\nA study on abalone habitat is about to get under way in south-west Victoria.\\nThe information collected will be used to ensure the industry is managed sustainably.\\nHarry Peeters, from the Western Abalone Divers Association, says aerial imagery, sonar devices and underwater video will be used to help scientifically describe the seabed.\\n\"Australia has one of the last sustainable wild catch abalone industries in the world,\" he said.\\n\"Most of the others have been fished to extinction.\\n\\nNurseries to encourage kids to garden\\nThe nursery industry is setting out to re-educate Australians about how to garden.\\nMarket research has found gardening is losing market share from changing lifestyles, bigger houses, smaller gardens and a loss of skills.\\nThe industry is fighting back and will soon launch a KidsGrow program, where local nurseries can work with schools to encourage children to garden.\\nJenny Lambert, from the Nursery and Garden Industry Association, says gardening has social, educational and environmental benefits.\\n\"The industry is concerned that the strength of the communities knowledge about gardening has dropped over the years and we\\'re worried about where the next generation of gardeners is coming from,\" she said.\\n\\nGlobal oil prices continue rising\\nGlobal oil prices continue to climb to record heights as Australia\\'s grain growers prepare for this year\\'s planting season.\\nLast night New York benchmark crude oil closed at more than $US70 a barrel for the first time in 23 years of trading.\\nCommodity analyst Tobin Gorey says running costs and fertiliser prices will rise further but there could be more demand for wheat and canola to make replacement biofuels.\\n\"The costs are actually higher so people need to be compensating farmers and so on for producing it so it is profitable otherwise they won\\'t stay in the business,\" he said.\\n\"But the other side of that too is that demand for things like ethanol or biodiesel that creates further demand for oilseeds and grains as well.\\n\"Perhaps that can also help boost the prices and is perhaps already influencing markets now to a small degree.\"\\nThe combination of rising fuel and fertiliser costs is cause for concern for many farmers.\\nGraingrowers in South Australia\\'s Mallee told Kerrie Lush cutting back on cropping is not an option and they are looking at other ways to reduce costs.\\n\"We\\'re certainly not cutting back on any acreage we\\'re sowing but David\\'s certainly going to try and do as much direct seeding without working up anything to save a bit of fuel that way,\" Val Gibbs from Wunkar said.\\nShe says fertiliser prices are also far more expensive than last year.\\n\"We have trialled putting zinc on through seed dressing instead of through fertiliser so that saves a bit of money that way.\"\\n\\nCall for bureaucrat or MP to act as AWB \\'moral conscience\\'\\nThe Queensland Nationals are calling for changes at the top of AWB to help protect the single desk for wheat exports.\\nMember for Hinkler Paul Neville wants a bureaucrat or government MP on AWB\\'s board to act as its \"moral conscience\" to stop future kickback controversies.\\nMr Neville says the appointment would prevent questions over AWB\\'s integrity if it retains the single desk.\\n\"It\\'s important that its probity be above any form of suspicion,\" he said.\\n\"For that reason I\\'d be more comfortable if we had a government appointee or someone from the public service on that board.\"\\nMeanwhile tough international wheat marketing conditions have been reflected in AWB\\'s first payment to growers from the 2005-06 national pool.\\nThe dividend of just over $30 per metric tonne for Australian premium white (APW) grade wheat represents just 16 per cent of the total price growers can expect to receive.\\nTony Smith from Plumgrove Commodity Trading says first payments are usually much higher but buyers are not prepared to pay higher grain prices.\\n\\nPoppy grower contracts slashed\\nPharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline has slashed Tasmanian poppy grower contracts by 90 per cent.\\nAlmost 500 poppy growers supply seed to the company with the lost contracts worth between $10 million and $12 million.\\nThe company says there is a depression in world market prices and continuing oversupply.\\nCompany researcher Dr Mike Doyle says the extraction plant will continue to run on existing stocks although the crop reduction will be for only one year.\\n\\nFruity fly precautions stall fruit, vege exports to Indonesia\\nFruit and vegetable exports to Indonesia remain at a standstill, after the introduction of new import protocols to prevent an outbreak of fruit fly.\\nExports of grapes, citrus, apples and pears are worth $35 million, but the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service says it has not issued any export permits on products affected by the new protocols, since they were imposed two weeks ago.\\nAustralian growers say the conditions of spraying and inspection make exports to Indonesia uncommercial and is an effectively a ban on their produce.\\nA trade official was dispatched to Jakarta last week, and the Federal Government has now asked Indonesia to urgently revert to the previous import protocol.\\n\\nFederal Govt funds target sugar industry\\nThe Federal Government has handed over $36 million in the latest round of sugar industry reform.\\nBundaberg Sugar will build a fertiliser production plant at its Tableland Mill, while the Proserpine Cooperative Sugar Milling Association will construct a plant to make a chemical from a cane by-product.\\n\\nWA bananas sent east\\nA small number of Western Australian bananas have been sent to the eastern states after a sharp drop in demand.\\nAfter cyclone Larry destroyed the Queensland crop, WA growers vowed to stay loyal to their local customers.\\nBut with bananas selling for about $6 a kilogram, shoppers decided to leave fruit on the shelf.\\nKevin Leahy from Carnarvon\\'s Sweeter Banana Co-operative says sending fruit east will not become a regular practice.\\n\"A lot of bananas came in from Queensland that had come down obviously with the cyclone, they cleaned them up and sent them over and there was no demand,\" he said.\\n\\nPush on for higher capital gains tax threshold\\nThere are calls for the capital gains tax (CGT) threshold to be lifted to at least $10 million to protect farmers.\\nCombined assets worth more than $5 million mean farmers cannot access small business concessions on the tax.\\nIt is starting to hit farm families when they try to expand, relocate or retire, because of rising property prices.\\nSouth Australian accountant Peter Hayes is part of a group that is lobbying federal politicians to increase the threshold, which has not changed for seven years.\\n\"One client of mine wanted to relocate and their combined assets were in the order of $6 million, so they didn\\'t comply with the CGT small business threshold and for them to move was going to cost them $1 million in tax,\" he said.\\n\\nCanada records 5th mad cow case\\nCanada has confirmed its fifth case of mad cow disease.\\nBut it is unlikely to cause further trade restrictions with the United States.\\nUS Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns says he expects no change in imports of Canadian beef and cattle under 30 months, after mad cow disease showed up in a six-year-old British Columbia dairy cow.\\nBut Greg Doud, with the National Cattlemen\\'s Beef Association, says based on the cow\\'s age there is a concern over the effectiveness of Canada\\'s ban on feeding cow parts to cows, thought to spread the disease.\\n\"Having the second animal that seems to be after the feed ban went into place in August of 1997... does seem to suggest that there is a feed ban compliance issue,\" he said.\\nThe US resumed imports of younger Canadian animals and their meat last year, but still prohibits trade in older ones.\\n\\nMutton making comeback in UK\\nIf you thought mutton was a cut of meat that went out with the war years and the depression, think again.\\nSheep producers in the UK have started a Mutton Renaissance Club to improve mutton\\'s image, which could increase Australia\\'s already booming export market.\\nJohn Thorley from the UK National Sheep Association says they have had a lot of help from their high profile patron.\\n\"Most people had given up on mutton a long, long time ago and then one or two people, his Royal Highness Prince Charles particularly, decided it was time we moved this thing on a bit,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt looks to hot rocks power potential\\nThe Victorian Government hopes hot granite rocks found underground will become a new source of green energy.\\nThe rocks heat water pumped into the ground, turning it into steam, which is then used to create power.\\nThe State Government has released 31 exploration permits across the state.\\nOil industry consultant Terry Donohoe says the interest in hot rocks as a source of geothermal energy is growing.\\n\"We know that Japan has got hot rocks and no other form of energy so the Japanese are very interested,\" he said.\\n\"Also of course in South Australia, and recently the Queensland Government let out some exploration permits.\\n\\nUrban dog owners take lead in sheepdog trials\\nCity dog owners are starting to replace retired farmers on the sheepdog trial circuit.\\nThe experts say they have noticed a big change, with city pet owners more interested in putting their dog and three sheep through an obstacle course, than competing in a traditional dog show.\\nSeven-time Australian representative Malcolm Taylor says while sheepdogs are being used less on the land, their popularity in the cities is growing.\\n\"But I think the future for dog trialing is going to alter quite a bit and you\\'ll see far more city dwellers that\\'ll have a working dog in the city,\" he said.\\n\\nIraq finalises wheat purchase\\nThe Iraqi Grains Board says it has finalised a $100 million wheat purchase from Australia after almost two months of negotiations.\\nAlthough the three companies selling the wheat say they have not yet signed a contract, the Grains Council of Australia believes terms have been agreed.\\nThe head of the Iraq Grains Board Khalil Aassi has told reporters the country will buy 350,000 tonnes of wheat at $190 a tonne from the Wheat Australia consortium.\\nThe deal was brokered by Trade Minister Mark Vaile, who visited Baghdad in February to save the Iraq wheat trade, after it announced it would no longer deal with monopoly exporter AWB because of the oil-for-food kickbacks scandal.\\nThe deal with Wheat Australia, which includes ABB, GrainCorp and Cooperative Bulk Handling, breaks AWB\\'s hold over wheat exports.\\nBut the Grains Council\\'s David Ginns says the deal will not be a lucrative one.\\n\"As we know, time costs money and they certainly spent a lot of time and money on finalising this deal,\" he said.\\nAustralia has traditionally supplied around a quarter of Iraq\\'s wheat, making it Australia\\'s third largest wheat market.\\n\\nCritical months\\nWheat exporter AWB says the next few months are critical for the global grain market, as weather conditions determine the size of the world crop.\\nAustralian growers have already received a lower than expected return on the 2005-06 crop, largely due to fluctuating demands for hard wheat varieties and tough international marketing conditions.\\nAnd general manager of AWB International, Sarah Scales, says global demand remains subdued.\\n\"I think the next couple of months are very critical, I think it\\'s make or break as far as the world wheat market goes for the next 12 months, depending on particularly rain conditions in the hard red winter wheat belt of the United States,\" she said.\\n\\nGraincorp to close 100 silos\\nGrain handling company Graincorp has confirmed it will close around 100 silos in the eastern states as part of a company restructure.\\nAs the major grain handler for the eastern states, Graincorp currently maintains 320 silo sites but now plans to close almost a third.\\nQueensland will lose 23, Victoria 32, with 38 to go in New South Wales.\\nWorkers at the silos were told about the closures yesterday, but were also told their jobs were safe.\\nGraincorp says the changes are in line with what growers want, which is better rates on rail services and a trend to using larger full-service silos.\\nRodeo organisers in Tasmania say they will not call off a national titles competition this weekend despite vandals destroying an arena.\\nOnly days ago the power box at the Harveydale Rodeo Arena was smashed to pieces and some time in the past 48 hours vandals entered the private property with wire cutters and shredded the perimeter fence.\\nRodeo Tasmania claims the offenders were people driven to action by a high-profile campaign against rodeo\\'s in recent times.\\nThat campaign has been spearheaded by Against Animal Cruelty Tasmania, which says it had nothing with the vandalism but concedes their campaign may have spurred others into action.\\n\"The public see what goes on at events they wouldn\\'t normally go to but somebody out there may have been compelled to take direct action after they\\'ve seen disturbing footage that we\\'ve ween on television,\" spokeswoman Emma Haswell said.\\n\\nMoney flows at Easter yearling sales\\nThe Easter yearling sales in Sydney have had a record $43 million opening

William Inglis and Son says the buoyant world economy has seen an increase in overseas buyers.\\n\"The strength of the stock market in both Tokyo and in Hong Kong has really driven this in the last 12 to 18 months,\" he said.\\n\"Five years ago both of those economies were under a fair bit of pressure following the SARS outbreak.\\n\\nFeed running low on stock routes\\nThe long paddock is getting crowded around Narrabri, in north-west New South Wales, where 25,000 head of livestock are searching for feed on the stock routes.\\nTwelve thousand cattle and 13,000 sheep have been on the road in recent weeks, with the routes almost at full capacity.\\nJamie Maddox from the Narrabri Rural Lands Protection Board, says it will be a harsh winter for many graziers already short of feed and water.\\n\"We received some good late January/early February rain, which gave us a good body of feed but it\\'s almost all disappeared now and it\\'s certainly becoming dry,\" he said.\\n\"A few dams in certain areas are drying up quickly and becoming boggy.\\n\\n\\'Pressure on negotiators\\' to secure better market access\\nSheepmeat producers are confident their latest round of talks with the European Commission will lead to a bigger slice of the export market for Australia.\\nIndustry delegates have met with EU commissioners in Brussels to push Australia\\'s case ahead of world trade talks later this month.\\nIan Feldtman from the Sheepmeats Council says the pressure is now on trade negotiators to clinch a deal.\\n\"The message we\\'re giving to our Government is that the decisions that are made during this round is something that our industry is going to have to live with for at least the next 10 years,\" he said.\\n\\nAust to increase agricultural aid to East Timor\\nAustralia\\'s direct involvement in rebuilding East Timor with agricultural aid is set to increase.\\nThe Australian Ambassador to East Timor says more than $40 million will be invested in aid this year, with agriculture representing $1.5 million.\\nMargaret Twomey says a new proposal aims to improve water harvesting and sanitation for remote communities across the rugged nation.\\n\"And we are now in talks with the Government and specifically the Prime Minister about a much bigger, more ambitious program, that would last up to 10 years, cost somewhere up to $50 million, to get clean water and sanitation to 80 per cent of the people in this country,\" she said.\\n\\nTexas weather could impact on Aust cotton prices\\nProlonged dry conditions in the American state of Texas could see a lift in cotton prices in Australia.\\nA global oversupply of cotton and the high Australian dollar are hurting returns for growers at present, with prices well below $400 a bale.\\nBut Cliff White from Queensland Cotton says if the situation in the United States deteriorates, prices for next season could rise above $430 a bale.\\n\"I think it\\'s difficult to see significant change to current crop prices, however over the next few weeks attention is going to be turning more so to the new crop production prospects in the northern hemisphere and at the moment there are one or two concerns on the horizon,\" he said.\\n\\nFruit fly outbreak could affect Tas market access\\nA fruit fly outbreak has been detected at the Northern Territory\\'s largest table grape producer.\\nThe central Australian town of Ti-Tree reported an isolated outbreak last month but recent tests now show the pest has spread to nearby Territory Grapes.\\nHorticulture advisory officer Geoff Kenna says the finding could affect market access to Tasmania.\\n\\nApple packhouse set for $2m upgrade\\nAustralia\\'s biggest apple packhouse is launching a multi-million dollar upgrade.\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran will unveil the $2 million upgrade of the Batlow Fruit Co-operative in southern NSW which features Australia\\'s first automatic blemish sorting system for apples.\\nThe technology has been imported from New Zealand and second grade fruit is identified electronically and then removed from the premium packing line.\\nIt is expected to increase its efficiency.\\nThe grower-owned co-operative was established in 1922 and produces 6,000 bins of apples each year.\\nThe district\\'s growers are suffering after prices fell last year under the weight of a big crop and imported apple juice.\\nIt is well recognised that the gap between city-slickers and their country cousins is growing.\\nBut farmers are out to restore their image by holding a National Farm Day next month.\\nVictorian wool producer Debbie Bain says farm gates will be opened to city people to help them better understand decisions made on a working property.\\n\"If we have somebody up here and we are bringing sheep into drench them, why do we give them these chemicals? We\\'re shoving these chemicals down their throats, what for?\" she said.\\n\"But when you explain about worm burden and and the detrimental [effect] that worms have on sheep, they\\'ll suddenly understand a little bit more about chemical use in animals.\"\\n\\nDrought program speeds up aid applications\\nFarmers will get faster access to drought assistance under new changes unveiled by state and federal agriculture ministers today.\\nThey are the first in a raft of drought assistance changes farmers hope to see over the next six months.\\nThe National Agricultural Monitoring System (NAMS) is expected to slash the time it takes to gather the information farmers need to lodge a drought assistance application.\\nIt will provide instant online rainfall, soil moisture, crop yield and commodity price information, streamlining contact between farmers and local, state and federal governments.\\nVice-president of the National Farmers Federation (NFF) Charles Burke says there needs to be fundamental change to the way drought assistance is delivered but this is a positive first step that will help farmers.\\n\"It\\'ll really give an overall picture of say one particular region and how it\\'s performing in a drought,\" he said.\\n\\nMoney laundering law changes \\'draconian\\'\\nRural bank branches and agencies could be under threat from proposed changes to federal money laundering legislation.\\nWhile the laws are designed to target organised crime, a report by the Chartered Secretaries of Australia says it will be too hard for many smaller bank agencies to comply.\\nChief executive Tim Sheehy says banks will need to have personal contact with clients, there will be changes to identification requirements and big fines.\\n\"They are draconian, they\\'re unfortunately a one size fits all approach,\" he said.\\n\"The way that the proposed legislation is, there\\'s no difference in penalties for a fairly minor transgression or a major $10 million one if you\\'re an agent.\\n\"[When] you\\'re faced with the risk of a major penalty for a small error, you\\'re probably going to pull out of the business.\"\\n\\nTruck drivers \\'living below poverty line\\'\\nNew research shows the families of truck drivers are suffering from record fuel prices, drought and long working hours.\\nMore than 70 per cent of the nation\\'s transport fleet is made up of small operators and the report by the Transport Women of Australia Association says tough times are being felt everywhere.\\nSpokeswoman Pam McMillan says the study backs up anecdotal evidence.\\n\"We did find that some operators are living below the poverty line and more than what we would like to consider,\" she said.\\n\"They might have a nice house but perhaps can\\'t afford to buy decent groceries every week and it\\'s not that they\\'re being frivolous, it\\'s just that the money\\'s not out there.\\n\\nDebate intensifies about fuel alternatives as oil prices rise\\nOil prices are not getting any better with the price of West Texas crude jumping again last night to $US72 a barrel.\\nAs prices go up, debate is intensifying about fuel alternatives.\\nBruce Robinson from the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas says Australia could halve its transport fuel usage by minimising its dependence on cars.\\nHe says fuel taxes should be increased similar to the system introduced by former prime minister Margaret Thatcher in United Kingdom in the 1980s.\\n\"If we continue to provide very cheap petrol and to give excise free petrol to everyone and subsidise it as happens in Queensland then we are just going to continue down the oil dependence [road],\" he said.\\n\"The enormous legacy Margaret Thatcher has left to Britain, she\\'s given the price signals that oil is going to be more expensive then they are not nearly so dependent on cheap fuel as we are.\"\\nThe higher price of crude oil is causing investors to take a closer look at the biofuels industry.\\nA new ethanol plant opens in the US every 10 days and around the world millions of dollars are being poured into biofuel projects to reduce dependence on oil.\\nAgribusiness investment adviser Shane Kelly says Australian investors are also keen to back a local ethanol industry.\\n\"It\\'s fair to say that as oil prices increase, the interest in ethanol plants has increased markedly,\" he said.\\n\\nCyclone causes minor damage\\nThere has been big rainfall in the wake of cyclone Monica in far north Queensland.\\nThe category three cyclone cross the north-east coast late yesterday but does not appear to have caused too much damage.\\nCyclone Monica followed almost exactly the same path as cyclone Ingrid which ripped through the region about 13 months ago.\\nMonica hit land just south of the Lockhart Aboriginal community.\\nVery few commercial fishing boats were sheltering in Lockhart River\\'s mangroves and so far there has been no reports of major incidents.\\nOn cattle properties in the cyclone\\'s path the strong winds brought down some branches, trees, sheds and fences but overall damage has been minor.\\nTom Burns manages Orchid Creek station and he says his biggest problem was finding his dogs.\\n\\nWheat bug discovery prompts questions\\nAustralian apple growers say the discovery of the wheat bug in Holland and Belgium raises new questions about the risks posed by New Zealand apple imports.\\nBiosecurity Australia is considering 34 submissions on the proposal to allow kiwi apples into Australia.\\nChairman of Apple and Pear Australia Darral Ashton says the wheat bug is endemic in New Zealand and should be given greater consideration.\\n\"News out of both Belgium and Holland that that wheat bug has been found and they are saying it arrived hitchhiking on New Zealand apples or New Zealand apple packaging,\" he said.\\n\"Whether that\\'s true or not I don\\'t know but it just highlights the concern that one of the processes has to be fumigation because while wheat bug may not affect the Batlow or the Australian apple and pear industry it would sure as hell play havoc on the Australian wheat industry.\"\\n\\nNew company secretary appointed to AWB\\nAWB has appointed a new company secretary, lawyer Logan Armstrong.\\nThe appointment comes after the resignations of Dr Richard Fuller and Jim Cooper as company secretaries last week.\\n\\nBroadacre grain growers want more debate over herbicide\\nWestern Australian broadacre grain growers say they will fight to keep using the herbicide 2,4-D Ester to control summer weeds.\\nThe Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority has suggested deregistering some forms of 2,4-D after claims chemical drift has affected other crops and the environment.\\nBut farmers say they have successfully managed the herbicide for 50 years with safeguards to protect horticultural and agricultural crops.\\nPhil Patterson from the Gnowangerup area of the great southern grain belt says there needs to be more debate.\\n\"Let\\'s sit back for a minute. Ester has been around for what 50 or 60 years and I\\'m getting a bit sick of these experts in Canberra trying to put their ideas on the rest of the world,\" he said.\\n\"I mean let them have a look at what was done in WA in the eighties and work from there.\\n\\nBetter prices expected for barley growers\\nBarley growers in South Australia can expect slightly better prices for their grain this year.\\nMalting barley prices will only rise by a couple of dollars but feed prices are expected to jump by up to $25 a tonne to $170.\\n\\nLack of skilled workers limiting new water projects\\nAttempts to fix Australia\\'s water shortage problems are suffering because a scarcity of skilled workers.\\nDelegates at a National Water Conference in Alice Springs have heard that a lack of qualified experts is limiting the development of new water saving projects.\\nChief executive of the Australian Water Association Chris Davis says the most severe shortages are in the science and engineering field.\\n\"Most organisations tend to be populated by middle-aged men who are about to retire in a year or two\\'s time so we\\'re staring down the barrel of an even worse shortage in a couple of years from now,\" he said.\\n\\nSalt interception project to benefit Murray River\\nA project to stop thousands of tonnes of salt entering the Murray River has just been opened near Kerang in north-west Victoria.\\nThe $13 million salt interception project will pump saline groundwater from Pyramid Creek into evaporation basins.\\nThe salt will then be commercially harvested instead of flowing into the Murray.\\nGoulburn Murray Water\\'s Carl Mather says the project will benefit both farmers and the environment.\\n\"The scheme will stop approximately 22,000 tonnes of salt reaching the River Murray,\" he said.\\n\\nRecord price set for yearling at Sydney sale\\nThe thoroughbred industry has set a new record price for a yearling at the Easter sales in Sydney.\\nSouth African trainer Charles Laird paid $3 million for a Redoutes\\' Choice colt last night, beating the previous record of $2.5 million.\\nThe record came as a surprise for the breeder.\\nIt is the best ever yearling sale on Australian soil.\\nAfter two days of selling, buyers have spent $68 million on 240 lots, with the average price at more than $100,000 above the previous year.\\nBreeder of the $3 million colt Arthur Mitchell of the Yarraman Park Stud in the Hunter Valley agreed there was some luck needed but says breeding judgment helped.\\n\"We started to get a bit of a whisper that the few Redoutes\\' were going quite well and we needed a stallion with a bit of size,\" Mr Mitchell said.\\n\\nGovt\\'s hands tied in water trading dispute\\nThe Federal Government says it is powerless to intervene in a cross-border dispute which is holding up water reform.\\nThree states have been fined millions of dollars for failing to meet agreed targets on interstate water trading.\\nVictoria, New South Wales and South Australia will have $10 million, $13 million and $3 million in competition payments withheld respectively, opening up a new row between them and the Federal Government.\\nSouth Australia and Victoria claim they are being punished for New South Wales failing to agree on their trading model but the Iemma Government says it has met all of its water trading requirements.\\nNational Water Commission chairman Ken Matthews will not buy into which states are responsible for the hold-up.\\n\"I\\'m not taking sides among the states, all three states have been working hard,\" he said.\\nBut Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says the Federal Government has no constitutional powers to end the state stand-off.\\n\"That is the constitutional reality,\" he said.\\nVictoria and South Australia have agreed on an exchange rate system of open-border trading but New South Wales is calling for a different model which takes into account its lower security water entitlements.\\nMinister for the River Murray in South Australia Karlene Maywald says she is bitterly disappointed because an agreement on water trading reform has been reached with Victoria.\\n\"We believe that\\'s grossly unfair and we think that South Australia is being docked $3 million when we have done everything we can to ensure that our borders are open,\" she said.\\n\\nGovt urged to buy Snowy Hydro scheme\\nThe Federal Government is being called on to buy Snowy Hydro and keep it as a publicly-owned water and power asset.\\nThe call was unanimously made at an angry meeting of 350 people at Cooma, in southern New South Wales last night, who are opposed to the joint state and federal sell-off.\\nThe scheme is expected to earn $3 billion if the sale goes ahead this year, but Snowy River Mayor Richard Wallace says public ownership is much more important.\\n\\nIncentives vital to NSW timber industry: Visy exec\\nThe timber industry says regional development will suffer if tax breaks for plantations are scrapped in next month\\'s Budget.\\nThe Federal Government is reviewing tax benefits for timber plantations under the Managed Investment Scheme.\\nBut the chief executive officer of Visy Industries, Harry Debney, says retaining the incentives is vital to plans to build a second timber mill in southern New South Wales.\\n\"We do need a long term sustainable timber industry and the investment scheme has really encouraged that softwood planting,\" he said.\\n\"So I guess if the region and the country want another for example $400 million investment in Tumut that is really fundamental to it.\\n\\nGrainCorp\\'s silos closure plan angers farming groups\\nAnger is mounting among eastern states\\' farming groups about plans by GrainCorp to close more than 100 grain receival sites.\\nSome farmers say the decision will force them to travel up to 100 kilometres more to deliver grain.\\nNorth-west Victorian farmer Rod Bishop says he will need to purchase another truck to be able to cart grain more efficiently.\\nAnd he says others might be left with no choice but to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up on-farm grain storage.\\n\"I personally don\\'t like it that much because you have to market the grain, keep the weevils out and all those issues come into it but you certainly couldn\\'t discount doing it, that\\'s for sure,\" he said.\\nGrainCorp chairman Don Taylor says the company will consider keeping the silos open if growers can guarantee supply.\\nThe grain handler has closed most sites which process less than 5,000 tonnes of grain.\\nMr Taylor says GrainCorp\\'s also willing to look at selling old infrastructure to farmers but does not think growers will be interested.\\n\\nWool industry\\'s survival dependent on young shoppers: designer\\nEnticing young shoppers to wool is critical to the industry\\'s survival, according to the head of leading men\\'s

family farms.\\nThere could also be a billion dollar budget bonus for rural roads with the National party believed to have secured money to link strategic roads to ports.\\nCurrently many farmers pay huge capital gains tax bills when they sell their farm because rising rural land prices have pushed their farm value above a $5 million threshold.\\nThe National Farmers Federation (NFF) says that means producers can no longer access small business tax concessions, making farm succession planning a costly process.\\nReports now suggest the Government will allow more farmers to get the tax concession.\\nNFF chief executive Ben Fargher says the mooted changes make sense.\\n\"Current rules mean farmers are clicked out of being able to access those exemptions, we\\'ve asked the Government to look at it,\" he said.\\nThere is also speculation the Government is considering a $1 billion roads package aimed at Queensland\\'s Bruce and Hume Highways.\\nNationals leader Mark Vaile will not confirm the spending but says he is in favour of more roads funding.\\n\\nAWB \\'apology document\\' suppression ruling looms\\nA bid by wheat exporter AWB to stop the release of an \"apology document\" is being heard in the Federal Court in Melbourne.\\nEarlier this month the AWB board voted to lodge the court challenge to AWB inquiry Commissioner Terence Cole\\'s decision to lift a non-publication order on the document, which was prepared for the company last year.\\nThe document was written by a crisis management expert, who suggested the company take a strategy of \"over-apology\".\\nCommissioner Cole ruled the document was not prepared for the purpose of legal advice and so could be published.\\nAn AWB spokesman said the board felt the document, and others to do with AWB\\'s internal investigation into the scandal, should be protected by legal professional privilege.\\nFormer managing director Andrew Lindberg has told the court he engaged a US public relations consultant to put together the statement of contrition ,which would be presented to the Cole inquiry.\\nUnder cross-examination he denied the statement was prepared for PR purposes but maintained it was part of the company\\'s legal strategy.\\nHowever Mr Lindberg acknowledged any statement to the inquiry would attract widespread publicity.\\nThe court is expected to make a decision today on whether to release the document.\\n\\nActing CEO resigns\\nMeanwhile AWB is looking for someone to fill its top job following the resignation of acting chief executive Peter Polson.\\nMr Polson replaced Mr Lindberg but in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, AWB says he wants to concentrate on other business interests.\\nMr Polson will continue to be an AWB director.\\nExecutive chairman Brendan Stewart will step into the vacancy until a new CEO is found.\\n\\nCredibility damaged\\nIn another development, a survey shows the credibility of the Federal Government and wheat exporter AWB has been damaged by the oil-for-food scandal.\\nRoy Morgan Research has surveyed more than 650 people living in rural and metropolitan areas about their perceptions of AWB and the Government since the Cole inquiry began.\\nDirector Gary Morgan says the public is not accepting the message being pushed by the Government about its knowledge of the deals and most have questions about AWB.\\n\"Sixty-five per cent said they did not act ethically, only 12 per cent said they did,\" Mr Morgan said.\\n\"We asked the question: \\'Do you think the Prime Minister John Howard acted ethically on this issue or not\\'.\\n\"Fifty-four per cent said no, he did not act ethically, 29 per cent said he did, 17 per cent were undecided.\\n\"We asked the same question about Alexander Downer. Fifty-six per cent said \\'he did not act ethically\\'.\\n\\nDarwin residents prepare for Monica\\'s onslaught\\nPreparations for tropical cyclone Monica are under way across the city of Darwin in the Northern Territory.\\nThe category 5 system has already created major disruptions with commercial fishing.\\nAs tropical cyclone Monica tracks west across the Gulf of Carpentaria, many of the 75 prawn trawlers that fish the remote off-shore regions took shelter in calmer waters to the south near Karumba and the Northern Territory-Queensland border.\\nOthers steamed back to their northern ports such as the Francis Bay Mooring Basin in Darwin.\\nThe interruption to the banana prawn harvest has created at least one week of disrupted fishing time and wasted fuel in not ideal fishing grounds.\\nOne of the largest companies, NewFishing Australia, estimates the disruption will cost them tens of thousands of dollars.\\nIt is an unusual sight to see trawlers and fishing vessels in the Darwin Port in the middle of the season which ends in just under one month.\\nThey are being double lashed to moorings with ropes and packed in tight side by side with tyre fenders between them to reduce friction.\\nAnd the level of water in this mooring basin will be dropped to allow these large vessels to rest on the bottom for the worst of the weather. \\n\\nFlooding\\nAnd rain from cyclone Monica is causing the worst floods in living memory in parts of far north Queensland.\\nResidents from a Cape York Peninsula aboriginal community and at least three families from cattle properties have been airlifted to drier ground.\\nGlen Shephard from Lilyvale Station, near Princess Charlotte Bay, says he has never seen anything like it\\n\"Wednesday afternoon it started to rain and by about seven o\\'clock the next morning we\\'d had seven inches so the water was starting to tickle our toes, sort a thing,\" he said.\\n\"It came through the house about fourteen or fifteen inches ... had to walk across the airstrip to get over on a bit of high ground.\\n\"It\\'s always a concern about crocs in this country [but] ... I didn\\'t tell the kids that.\"\\nSenior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology David Alexander says Monica is one of the most perfect cyclone systems he has seen.\\nHe says it is far more dangerous than cyclone Larry which caused massive destruction in far north Queensland last month.\\n\"It\\'s probably the best developed cyclone I have seen in many, many years,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s got a perfect circular eye, it\\'s right at the top of a category 5 range, so it\\'s a very, very severe cyclone.\\n\\nEgg producers unhappy at adjustment package rejection\\nEgg producers are furious that a meeting of state and federal primary industries ministers has refused to endorse a $23 million adjustment package.\\nThe funds would have helped farmers to leave the sector if they could not afford to upgrade to bigger hen cages under new animal welfare laws.\\nPresident Jeff Ironside says the changes are being imposed by government and compensation should be paid.\\n\"Unfortunately you can\\'t do anything with the old systems because they don\\'t lend themselves to tampering with the size,\" he said.\\n\"So egg producers virtually have to go out and buy new equipment to comply with the new regulations because it is around about 50 bucks a bird, you know a farm with 20,000 birds, a million dollars.\"\\n\\nMcGuigan Simeon rejects analyst\\'s prices\\nWine giant McGuigan Simeon has told growers in the Riverland and Sunraysia it will not accept prices set by an independent analyst last week.\\nThe analyst was called into settle a dispute over how much the winery was prepared to pay growers for grapes already delivered.\\nChris Byrne from the Riverland Wine Grape Growers Association says the company must now explain why it will not accept the prices.\\n\\nHigh bacteria levels stop oyster production\\nOyster production in the Bellinger River on New South Wales mid-north coast has been halted due to unacceptably high levels of E. coli.\\nThe New South Wales Food Authority has stopped harvesting Sydney Rock Oysters indefinitely.\\nJohn Lindsay from the Bellinger Oyster Growers Association says growers are shocked and more should have been done earlier by authorities.\\n\"We\\'re all extremely surprised because we always thought the Bellinger River was one of the pristine rivers,\" he said.\\n\"We always thought it was one of the best rivers on the north coast. Obviously not. We knew there were some problems in there.\\n\"We\\'ve been onto council, we\\'ve been onto the Food Authority to try and clear up some hot spots.\\n\\nFarmers hit out at dept land clearing inspection methods\\nFarmers in western New South Wales have vowed to prevent state Department of Natural Resources officials from entering their properties to conduct land clearing inspections.\\nThe farmers are angry at recent compliance checks where the department used a police escort.\\nDoug Menzies says 200 farmers who attended a meeting in Nyngan are fed up with what they say is unworkable legislation and heavy handed government approach.\\n\"We\\'ve tried every legal avenue we can and we just get stonewalled every time,\" he said.\\n\\nIrrigators confident of accessing water from gas reserves\\nSouthern Queensland irrigators are confident they will be next in line to access vast amounts of water from underground coal seam gas reserves.\\nThe Federal Government has announced a $10 million project to allow the Dalby Town Council to use 1,000 megalitres of water extracted along with natural gas by Arrow Energy.\\nCotton grower Paul McVeigh says irrigators are making an application to the National Water Commission so they access the water.\\n\"The challenges I suppose this is new water, it\\'s water that\\'s never been available before and I think the exciting side of it is that at this stage you know water is probably the biggest issue in the whole Australian community and here we are sitting on a great asset,\" he said.\\n\\nPotato harvesters dig up WWII mortar bomb\\nA team of potato harvesters in northern Tasmania dug up more than they bargained for at the weekend - a World War II mortar bomb.\\nArmy bomb disposal experts were flown from Melbourne to the Campbell Town farm and declared the rusty three kilogram bomb to be a harmless practice round.\\nMajor Danny Rowe says they are called out to Tasmania on average once a month and only 10 per cent of bombs are found to be live.\\n\"Some of the areas around here were used during the war and post war as practice ranges, for troops that were billeted down in Tasmania, so some of these areas have old ammunition on them that have been fired during the war,\" he said.\\n\\nMcGauran denies breaking promise over fruit code of conduct\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has been accused of breaking an election promise, by not including the big supermarkets in a mandatory code of conduct for the fruit and vegetable sector.\\nDespite concerns within his own party, Mr McGauran is expected to take the code to Cabinet tomorrow.\\nNational Party backbenchers say the Government is not delivering on what it promised.\\nIn a statement during the election former leader John Anderson said the code would give producers a fairer deal on terms of trade and in resolving disputes with produce buyers, who are in many instances large supermarket chains.\\nMember for Mallee John Forrest says the Government may as well not have the code at all if it does not include the big retailers.\\n\"To leave them out isn\\'t delivering what we said we would deliver,\" he said.\\nThe Government also faces a legal challenge from wholesale markets who are included in the code.\\nCentral Markets Association spokesman Andrew Young says the current plan gives supermarkets an unfair advantage over market wholesalers.\\n\"It should be workable and right now we\\'re facing something which in many respects doesn\\'t meet any of those criteria,\" he said.\\nBut Mr McGauran denies he is breaking an election promise and says the code was never meant to include retailers like Coles and Woolworths.\\nHe says the real problems for growers occur when they send produce to market wholesalers.\\n\"Retailers were never part of the election commitment which was written down,\" he said.\\n\\nCitrus company blocks canker surveillance officials\\nOne of Australia\\'s major citrus growing companies has closed its gates to Queensland\\'s citrus canker surveillance authorities.\\nThe discovery of canker at Emerald in 2004 decimated the local industry, with the destruction of tens of thousands of fruit trees.\\n2PH Farms says the blockade is to support local orchardist Maurie Iddles, who missed out on financial assistance in the wake of the outbreak.\\nCraig Pressler of 2PH says it was not an easy choice, with both farmers risking their plans to replant orchards next year.\\n\"Well the decision wasn\\'t taken lightly,\" he said.\\n\"We wish to support Maurie and Connie in their fight for fair and equitable treatment with regards to compensation.\\n\\nNZ apple growers hit back at wheat bug claims\\nKiwi apple growers are angry at claims a native New Zealand wheat bug was spread to Europe by apple packaging.\\nAustralian growers say the discovery of wheat bug in Belgium and Holland could raise new concerns about the risks posed by New Zealand apple imports.\\nBut Peter Beaven from Pipfruit New Zealand says a study has shown the pest has a limited ability to survive cool storage.\\n\"We don\\'t believe for a moment it got there on apples it must have got there on some other commodity that\\'s not cool stored or on the clothing of tourists,\" he said.\\n\\nDecision reserved on AWB \\'apology\\' document\\nA Federal Court Judge has reserved his decision on whether to make AWB\\'s so-called apology document public.\\nIn hearings yesterday AWB argued the apology was drafted as part of the company\\'s legal preparations for the Cole Inquiry.\\nAppearing as a witness for AWB, former managing director Andrew Lindberg told the court fellow board member Peter Polson had recommended a US public relations consultant to help draft the apology, given his experience with crisis management.\\nMr Polson resigned as acting chief executive of the company last Friday.\\nBut counsel for the Commonwealth said the main purpose for the draft apology was to influence public opinion and help AWB\\'s public relations strategy, by submitting the document to the Inquiry.\\nJustice Young has reserved his decision for a date to be set.\\n\\nS Africa begins

been rated a destructive category five yesterday.\\nChris Barnard from Arafura Pearls, north of Nhulunbuy says it is a lucky escape.\\n\"As the winds intensified, we would have got up to about 180-200km/hr winds,\" he said.\\n\"We were lucky this cyclone season in the NT. Unfortunately what I have heard from WA is that they have had a bit of a rough time. But in the NT we were saved this season. It was just a reminder to be on your toes the whole time. You never know when one might hit, even as late as it is in this season.\"\\n\\nStormy weather causes diamond price drop\\nThe stormy weather across northern Australia is affecting the price of diamonds.\\nProduction at the world\\'s biggest diamond mine, Argyle Diamonds in WA, dropped significantly in the first quarter due to wet weather.\\nDiamond expert James McGlew says the production drop, along with a rush of diamond buying worldwide, is going to make a sparkler much more expensive.\\n\"I mean over the last three years we\\'ve seen average price rises totalling about 60 per cent in price,\" he said.\\n\\nCazaly court action chances \\'relatively slim\\'\\nA resources analyst says a Federal Court bid over the rights to an iron ore tenement in Western Australia\\'s north-west has little chance of success.\\nCazaly Resources pegged the large deposit in September when it become clear mining giant Rio Tinto had forgotten to renew its lease.\\nMines Minister John Bowler has ruled the land be returned to Rio, resulting in a $75 million loss for Cazaly shareholders on the stock exchange yesterday.\\nBut Hartley\\'s Rob Brierley says Cazaly\\'s court action could be in vain.\\n\\nMcGuigan denies grower grape prices claims\\nWine giant McGuigan Simeon has denied grower claims it will not pay new grape prices set by an independent analyst.\\nGrower associations in the Riverland and Murray Valley claim the winery has written to growers saying it will not accept the new prices.\\nBut chief executive Dane Hudson says there has been a misunderstanding.\\n\\nNew techniques found to reduce fishing deaths\\nA four year project has shown commercial anglers can use long lines for deep sea fishing without killing thousands of seabirds.\\nIn the past trailing baited hooks behind trawlers in Antarctic waters has caused the deaths of up to 3,000 birds a year.\\nTechniques, including quickly sinking hooks and hauling them in differently, have reduced sea bird deaths to zero.\\nLes Scott from fishing company Petuna Sealord says other countries should follow Australia\\'s lead.\\n\"The statistics show that the mitigation methods work because if you look at our neighbours their bird mortality is still 2,000 plus,\" he said.\\n\\nEast Timor joins in Anzac services\\nA special Anzac Day dawn service has been held in Dili, the capital of East Timor.\\nIt has commemorated 11 Australian soldiers believed to have died there in 1942.\\nDuring World War II, Australia\\'s Sparrow Force worked deep in the rugged mountain jungles of East Timor.\\nHelio Tavares says they conducted guerrilla operations against the Japanese and were supported by the Timorese people.\\n\"During World War II the Timorese, supported the Australians, because they didn\\'t want East Timor to be invaded by the Japanese Army,\" he said.\\n\"Throughout the four years of struggle, up to 44,000 Timorese died assisting Australian soldiers.\\n\"The Timorese really value that relationship with Australia and we can see it today.\\n\"The Prime Minister addressing the people and saying that Australia is a very important neighbour and a partner in the development of the

leave home.\\nTeleworking would allow women to utilise their education and professional experience without the need to travel long distances.\\nChris Capel from the Foundation for Australian Agricultural Women says getting companies to take on teleworkers is the biggest challenge.\\n\"It\\'ll be convincing employers and business [that] will be the major hurdle I think,\" she said.\\n\\nMulesing replacement trial axed\\nThe race to find an alternative to sheep mulesing by 2010 has hit a major hurdle, with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) banning a key product being used in trials.\\nAustralian Wool Innovation (AWI) has been injecting collagenase into sheep\\'s backsides to inhibit the growth of wool.\\nBut the trials have now been dumped, with AQIS warning the biological agent poses a biosecurity risk and could carry mad cow disease.\\nAWI\\'s Scott Williams says while it is costly to lose the research, other trials are in progress.\\n\"It\\'s always costly to try and do R&D at the sort of pace we\\'re doing it at because we\\'ve only got a very short deadline, of course,\" he said.\\n\"That means you sometimes duplicate things because you can\\'t afford to fail, so we\\'ve had, you know, three or four different fronts moving forward at once, even though we may only need one or two of those.\\n\\nCourt opposes chicken meat producers\\' bid for joint action\\nFarmers have lost a five year legal battle for the right to band together to refuse to supply processors.\\nThe court action was launched by Victoria\\'s chicken meat producers, who wanted to set a precedent for other farmers with limited contract options, including the potato, wine grape and dairy sectors.\\nUnder the Trade Practices Act, individuals can refuse to supply produce, but not groups.\\nPresident of the Victoria Farmers\\' Federation\\'s chicken meat group, John Clarke, says the Federal Court\\'s decision is a blow.\\n\"The processors are dealing opportunistically with growers and abusing their market power but they haven\\'t seen fit, or the tribunal hasn\\'t seen fit, to go the extra step and give us [the] right to have countervailing power.\\n\\nGrain growers\\' future not looking rosy\\nChanging weather patterns, weed resistance and higher input costs are putting pressure on grain farm incomes, despite more land being cropped than ever before.\\nIn the short term, farm incomes will go up but figures from ABARE and the Grains Research and Development Corporation, say the picture is not as rosy further out.\\nIncreased production in Australia and strong global competition will keep grain prices low.\\nAgricultural analyst Neil Clark says average-sized farmers have tough times ahead.\\n\"The price of grain has been falling at about an average of 2.2 per cent for the last 28 years and yet we all know that the costs of fertiliser, fuel and in particular debt servicing are going to be at an all time high for the coming cropping season and the commodity prices aren\\'t all that great yet,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s always great for the top 25 per cent and if we look at any of the ABARE studies they do shine.\\n\\nLack of rain doesn\\'t prevent crop sowing\\nCrop sowing is under way in some parts of the country, despite the lack of a significant autumn break in Australia\\'s south-east.\\nPlenty of unseasonal summer rain has led Western Australian growers to plant canola and lupins earlier than usual, to make the most of sub soil moisture.\\nTenindewa farmer Glen Thomas is planting 6,690 hectares but says he is holding back on certain crops, like lupins, because of poor prices.\\n\"We probably would have put even more in, given the summer rain. But we\\'re just going to cap it at [1,000] where that\\'s a big enough risk as it is,\" he said.\\n\\nApril rainfall sets Darwin record\\nThe passage of tropical cyclone Monica in the Northern Territory has resulted in new rainfall levels.\\nDarwin has had its wettest April since falls records began 65 years ago.\\nA total of 383 millimetres has fallen so far this month and weather bureau forecaster Patrick Ward says that is close to four times the average.\\n\"Darwin had about 53 mm at the airport, down towards Adelaide River it was a lot heavier. East branch Adelaide River had 224 mm, which is quite a lot,\" he said.\\n\"This time of year it\\'s sort of the clearing up period of the monsoon season and into the dry. It\\'s unseasonably late to get a cyclone. It\\'s just about the latest cyclone we have had.\"\\n\\n\\'Smart card\\' introduction raises regional concerns\\nConcerns have been raised about potential logistical, cost and privacy problems in regional Australia with the introduction of a national identification card.\\nFederal Cabinet is today considering the so-called \"smart card\" which all Australian adults would need to access Medicare, welfare and tax benefits.\\nBut independent federal MP for New England Tony Windsor says he has seen no evidence that the benefits would justify the expense.\\n\"Well very, very costly of course for people who have got distance and remoteness to contend with,\" he said.\\n\"What if there are technical problems, if that personal information is on a card and it is lost.\\n\"We can see what computer fraud can do in accessing people\\'s information.\\n\\nRegional family day care operators fear for future\\nFamily day care operators in many regional areas are worried they could be forced to reduce services or even close within months because of funding shortfalls.\\nThe threat comes on top of a drop in available childcare places over the past year due to changes to funding.\\nTracey Guerin from the Alice Springs Family Day Care Centre says the situation will get worse unless the federal Budget includes more financial support.\\n\"I have grave concerns for the future of the service. I don\\'t believe that we\\'ll be funded to the same level as we have been and I think that we will either have to look at offering less of a service or closing all together,\" she

cut obesity rates in Western countries.\\nLeft to choose their own food, research has shown animals will first seek out protein and never become obese.\\nIn a natural state, the same is true for humans.\\nBut Professor Steve Simpson from the University of Sydney says modern diets with high fat and salt contents trick people into overeating.\\n\"But if you simply change the ratio and you can do that in one or two ways - incorporating high quality protein items in the diet and by that I mean lean meat or fish or high quality vegetable proteins,\" he said.\\n\\nUpper Hunter stallion breaks stud fee record\\nA new Australian record for a stud fee has been set by the stallion Redoute\\'s Choice.\\nThe Arrowfield stud in the Upper Hunter of New South Wales has increased the champion

export system by funding a study which it believes will call for the removal of the single desk.\\nOpposition agriculture spokesman Gavan O\\'Connor says grains industry think tank, Single Vision Australia, has commissioned a report into the single desk.\\nSingle Vision is funded by the Government through the Grains Research and Development Corporation and has asked the Centre for International Economics to carry out research into the wheat export system.\\nAnd Mr O\\'Connor says that spells trouble for the single desk.\\n\"It\\'s the sort of organisation I think you employ when you want a hatchet job on the issue,\" he said.\\nThe Government denies it had anything to do with setting up the report.\\nAnd Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says while the Government will consider its findings, it will not necessarily become policy.\\n\"It will be an interesting read and whether or not it ever becomes public policy I wouldn\\'t know,\" he said.\\nThe report is due for release in the next few weeks.\\nMeanwhile hundreds of grain growers from across Western Australia have gathered in the wheatbelt town on Cunderdin to show support for the single desk.\\nDeputy Prime

regulation\\nThere is a call today for a national approach to the regulation of gene technology because of confusion caused by state-based bans on genetically modified (GM) crops.\\nThe Gene Technology Act was introduced in 2000 to oversee the use of GM technology in Australia but since then all states except Queensland and the Northern Territory have imposed their own rules.\\nChairwoman of an independent panel which has reviewed the Act, Susan Timbs, says the regulations have become too confusing.\\n\"This was a point that was made very strongly to us by industry, that if they go through and get their approval from the regulator, suddenly they feel that there is a complete block because they don\\'t know the criteria that they need to meet to convince the relevant state governments,\" she said.\\n\\nRemote station may be nominated as alternative dump site\\nThere is speculation in the Northern Territory that a remote cattle station could be nominated as an

environmentalists are worried about other impacts.\\nA Department of Environment and Heritage report released for public comment last week is considering the importation of bumblebees for controlled crop pollination.\\nQueensland greenhouse tomato grower David Da Pra says it would dramatically boost production.\\n\"Bring higher pollination, which will give better fruit quality, better shelf life, more saleable fruit,\" he said.\\nThe Wide Bay Conservation Council\\'s Pam Soper wants further research into artificial pollination, strongly opposing the importation of the bumblebee.\\n\\nResource boom behind zinc mine\\'s reopening\\nThe booming base metals price has led to the reopening of an old zinc mine in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.\\nCanadian company Teck Cominco will reopen its underground mine near Fitzroy Crossing because of a recent hike in zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange.\\nTeck Cominco exploration general manager Wayne Spilsbury says zinc is performing well after a three-year price glut.\\n\"We were watching the stocks of zinc in the LME warehouses and making sure those numbers were coming down before we made a decision to reopen.

The council noted the tree disease, native to South and Central America, had reached Hawaii, and there are fears it could get into Australia. Indeed the council went so far as to suggest that prevention and contingency plans for the disease be prepared as a matter of urgency. The disease attacks plants under two years of age, causing leaf and shoot dieback and killing the plant. Potentially it could kill not only large numbers of young plantation trees but also native eucalypts, as it has a wide number of eucalypts which could act as hosts. Ensis have predicted the areas most likely to be at risk are the NT, coastal Queensland and NSW. However, generally warmer conditions could see it easily colonise regions further south. In Brazil, there is a 40 per cent fatality from the disease.\\n\\nFootrot control review\\nThe continuation of the state\\'s sheep footrot control program has been assured after a comprehensive review by representatives from the South Australian Sheep Advisory Committee, the South Australian Farmers Federation and PIRSA. In the 1950s, about one third of the sheep flocks in the south-east were suffering from the disease but eradication programs and improved diagnosis have eradicated the most virulent strains. Sheep with the disease find it difficult to walk and can get fly blown feet and legs from the disease, and they must be quarantined. Footrot is still a notifiable disease although new technologies would be trialed to find better control methods.\\n\\nMore work to be done on fresh produce code of conduct\\nThe Federal Government denies it has broken a key election promise for a mandatory code of conduct for the fresh produce sector, despite further delays.\\nThe code, to improve relations between wholesalers and growers, was to have been introduced within 100 days of the last election.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran now admits there is still more work to be done after Cabinet again failed to agree on the plan this week.\\nHe also says statements by former deputy prime minister John Anderson that the code would include the big supermarket chains have been misinterpreted.\\n\"I thought that was quite ambiguous and was a broadening out of his other statements that I\\'ve had regard to,\" he said.\\n\"So it might have been in Mr Anderson\\'s mind to expand it to supermarkets but that would have been policy on the run.\"\\nThe National Farmers Federation says the Government\\'s 100 day deadline was always unachievable.\\nDespite wanting the retail sector included originally, vice-president Charles Burke now just wants the policy in place as soon as possible.\\n\\nVeg prices increase not flowing through to farmers\\nNew figures show vegetables are costing 15 per cent more than at this time last year.\\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics says the cost of food overall jumped more than 4 per cent last quarter due to a hot summer and higher costs for inputs like fuel and packaging.\\nMike Badcock from vegetable grower group AUSVEG says despite the rises, farmers are not seeing any increase in their profits.\\n\"The very hot summer that eastern Australia experienced this year really affected production, it basically cooked the product in the ground and it wasn\\'t suitable so there\\'s been some quite large shortages of product - that\\'s the reason prices have gone up,\" he said.\\n\"The two major supermarket chains control about 76 per cent of the market, they\\'ve never had so much market share and they\\'re becoming quite aggressive on what prices they pay for product.\\n\\nSecurity tight for World Meat Congress\\nAnimal rights campaigners have attempted to disrupt the World Meat Congress in Brisbane, where 600 delegates are discussing the future of the industry.\\nProtesters crying \"murder\" also say the Federal Government is sanctioning animal cruelty.\\nSecurity is tight at the World Meat Congress with police surrounding the Convention Centre in Brisbane and security guards everywhere inside the building.\\nThe protest comes as Australia is experiencing unprecedented growth in the cattle and beef industry.\\nCattle numbers are expected to grow by nearly 3 million head in the next four years and the value of exports has risen by $870 million since 2003, that\\'s on the back of growth in Japan and Korea.\\nBut keynote speaker at the Congress, Professor David Hughes, says while industry cannot ignore concerns about animal welfare, the total opposition to the farming of livestock represents a minority worldwide.\\n\\nMurray River irrigators to sell water to Govt\\nThe Federal Government will buy back water from Murray River irrigators to meet its targets for environmental flows.\\nIrrigators will be able to apply to sell water they have saved through improved on-farm infrastructure.\\nIt is designed to help supply 500 gigalitres of water under the Living Murray Initiative.\\nParliamentary Secretary for water policy Malcolm Turnbull says the tender process will be put forward at the next ministerial council meeting.\\n\\nOil-for-food inquiry adjourned\\nApart from one last witness, public hearings at the oil-for-food inquiry are over.\\nCommissioner Terence Cole has formally adjourned the four month investigation.\\nFormer UN customs official, Felicity Johnstone, will fly to Australia in mid-May to give evidence.\\n\\nHigh Aussie dollar hurts farm profits\\nEconomists say the rising Aussie dollar is cutting into farm returns.\\nThe dollar has risen five cents over the past few days and overnight lifted above 75 US cents.\\nWestpac senior economist Justin Smirk says speculation over an interest rate rise next month has fuelled the increases.\\nBut he says other factors are also having an impact.\\n\"Commodity prices globally really haven\\'t gone anywhere over the last 12 months or if anything perhaps have eased a bit,\" he said.\\n\"So this strong Aussie dollar, of course, is crimping back our exporters income for the farmers and really when you are thinking about the farm sector - higher interest rates yes they will bite a bit around the margin.\\n\"But perhaps the real significance is what we can\\'t control and that is the rainfall out there and that is really going to be the driving factor of whether farmers have a good year or not.\"\\nThe higher dollar and a large volume of wool has not helped the wool market, with sales resuming after the Easter recess.\\n\\nWool bale sold to fashion house for $63,000\\nThe finest bale of wool ever offered in Australia has been sold for around $63,000.\\nThe bale of 11.7 micron wool was sold by Ian and Kaye Appledore from Victoria\\'s Wimmera region for 70,000 cents a kilogram to Italian fashion house, Lora Piana.\\nIan Appledore is happy with the price, but says the bale was not the best they had to offer yesterday.\\n\"11.7 [micron] wasn\\'t our topline bale, our topline bale eventually sold as well once again to Lora Piana,\" he said.\\n\"We sold that one for 48. The reason the 11.7 was our second line bale was it just didn\\'t have the strength of the first one.\\n\\nTennant Creek residents oppose toxic dump\\nResidents of Tennant Creek in the Territory have rejected suggestions that a national toxic waste dump be built near the town.\\nMuckaty station just north of Tennant Creek has been identified as a possible site.\\nThree sites near Alice Springs and Katherine have been short-listed for the dump, but there is growing speculation that none of them will be chosen.\\n\\nVic Govt to challenge wind farm ban\\nThe Victorian Government will take Federal Court action in a bid to overturn a decision to stop a wind farm development in south Gippsland.\\nFederal Environment Minister Ian Campbell blocked the $220 million project because of a threat to the endangered orange bellied parrot.\\nWhile the State Government says the decision was unreasonable local farmer Don Jelbart believes it was the right one.\\n\"They keep coming back to the parrot but there\\'s 17 threatened species there,\" he said.\\n\\nAdelaide River battles flooding\\nThe Northern Territory community of Adelaide River is battling flooding in the wake of tropical cyclone Monica.\\nMore than 150 millimetres of rain fell on Anzac Day alone this week.\\nKai Hansen lives on Goat Island on the western edge of Kakadu National Park and says brown, crocodile-infested waters are roaring past his house.\\n\"There is no dry land left at all. We knew this beforehand that there is a potential for it to come up here but 800mm of rain in one month, and 290mm of rain in 19 hours we had - it\\'s an incredible amount of water,\" he said.\\n\"I don\\'t think we will see any crocs because as soon as water gets a bit rough the crocs seek quieter land.\\n\"We don\\'t worry about it, we walk around chest deep in the water now and then outside to salvage more things and get the boats and barges tied up and get to the generator shed, and we don\\'t even consider it.\"\\n\\nCouncils seek to fill jobs through Melbourne advertising\\nA group of western Victorian councils have resorted to advertising in Melbourne newspapers to try to lure workers.\\nArarat Rural City and the shires of Northern Grampians and Pyrenees will use ratepayer and state funds for the campaign, to address the skills shortage.\\nArarat Council\\'s rural development manager Mark Hogan says tradespeople, medical professionals and agricultural workers are all in short supply.\\n\"The key area that made our mind up that this was the way we needed to go was some recent research from state and federal governments which showed that the number of people applying for jobs in our region and the Wimmera area is very small,\" he said.\\n\\nSterile fruit flies fail to satisfly partners\\nSterile fruit flies have been touted as a way of controlling numbers of the pest insect but researchers say they are not proving to be satisfying mates.\\nResearch has shown female fruit flies are attracted to the sterile males but they are not always satisfied and head off looking for other mates.\\nDr Phil Taylor from Macquarie University says they are now trying to fix the problem, to stop them from causing major damage in horticultural regions.\\n\"Wild flies don\\'t seem to mind mating with them, however the sterile males have some issues with the amount of sperm they transfer and then the female\\'s likely to re-mate,\" he said.\\n\\nStudies to investigate GM crop issues\\nThe Federal Government has placed further pressure on the states to lift their bans on genetically modified crops by announcing eight case studies into the sector\\'s most contentious issues.\\nThe studies will be done by the Bureau of Rural Sciences and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, and the private sector will contribute.\\nThere will be four different reports on the impacts of releasing genetically modified canola, while weed control and the affect on organic farmers will also be considered.\\n\\nWater trading available for southern Qld farmers\\nQueensland has given the go ahead for its first water trading scheme involving river systems.\\nPreviously farmers could only buy water attached to land or from government-run irrigation schemes.\\nWater trading will now be introduced across the Moonie and Warrego catchments in southern Queensland.\\nAn entitlement to access 120 megalitres a day from the Moonie River will be auctioned next month and Clayton Smith from Elders believes it could sell for well over $2 million.\\n\"Existing irrigators will be keen to get more water to do more development on their properties and secure their future,\" he said.\\n\\nMini turbine generates farm power\\nA Victorian dairy farmer has invented a mini hydroelectric turbine to generate on-farm power.\\nThe Sundermann turbine, named after farmer Fred Sundermann, can be used in slow-moving water, like irrigation channels and streams.\\nIt is about the size of a large washing machine and is designed to generate power in remote areas.\\nMr Sundermann says he hopes his turbine can be used to power remote communities around the world.\\n\"I have dreams for the turbine,\" he said.\\n\\nRoo shooter numbers may threaten industry\\nThere is concern a record number of kangaroo shooters in Queensland is threatening the industry\\'s future.\\nUp to 2,000 shooters are registered in Queensland, with 400 new licences granted since October alone.\\nJeffrey Newton from the Macropod and Wild Game Harvesters Association says record roo meat prices mean too many people are vying for a share of already limited quotas.\\n\"As with any industry, big dollars attract people that are chasing that quick dollar but unfortunately this industry can\\'t sustain that,\" he said.\\n\\nWater in the bank\\nWhile water scarcity is not much of an issue in the Top End at the moment, in central Australia attempts to develop a new horticulture industry depend very much on new water saving technology. The water re-use project in Alice Springs has been under development for some time but emerging technology could make a number of similar projects viable and workable. Professor Stuart White from Sydney\\'s University of Technology has worked on water saving projects with governments and councils around Australia and he says there is a new sense of urgency to develop water savings projects. \"When we start to move away from the urban sector and talk about water use more generally and remember 80 per cent of water is not used in towns and cities it\\'s actually used in irrigated agriculture and so on, we do have to take a bit of a long hard look at some of the industries that are using water and say is this appropriate and what is the trade off between the impact of some of these industries and the impact on water ways and the benefit we derive from them. However there is huge scope for efficiency there, I mean we\\'re talking about efficiency levels which can be improved even beyond what we\\'re talking about in the cities, in terms of relatively low cost savings, and some of those are starting to be picked up and that\\'s a good thing.\"\\n\\nCrop planting to follow weekend rain\\nDespite the high diesel prices, crop planting is expected to get into full swing across much of Victoria and South Australia this week after good weekend rain.\\nMost of South Australia\\'s growing areas had rain and there were also falls of between 44 and 30 millimetres across northern Victoria.\\nVictorian talkback caller Shirley is certainly relieved.\\n\"We\\'ve had 51 millimetres. We had one of those scattered thunderstorms. We were actually away for the day and we got home here at about 6:00pm and the further we came towards home, there was more water and we got home and there was just water everywhere,\" she said.\\n\\nAWB delegation to investigate wheat pesticide find\\nA 50,000 tonne shipment of Australian wheat has been stopped from unloading in India after tests revealed unacceptable levels of pesticide.\\nThe shipment, which left the port of Adelaide last week, is now on standby at Chennai port, awaiting further testing from Indian and Australian authorities.\\nIt is the first consignment of a half million tonne tender won by exporter AWB and spokesman Peter McBride says the company is sending its own delegation.\\n\"They have identified that there is a high level of pesticide reading, so AWB is sending a high level delegation to India which will leave today to meet with our customers to address the issue and obtain more information,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve run tests here as the ships leave and we\\'ll do that for future vessels.\\n\"We can\\'t really provide further details until we have met with our customers and hopefully we\\'ll have further information later this week or early next week.\"\\n\\nTrucking companies to pass on increased fuel costs\\nThe transport industry will start passing on the increased cost of fuel this week as companies begin to include fuel surcharges in contracts.\\nThe Australian Trucking Association (ATA) has been urging operators to act for some time, especially smaller businesses who are struggling to absorb the higher diesel costs.\\nThe ATA\\'s Stuart St Clair says he is relieved at the industry\\'s decision and believes most customers have been expecting it.\\n\"I think the majority of customers would understand because they\\'d be under some similar price pressures themselves, particularly those that have a lot of vehicles on the road, whether they be stock and station agents or whether they be farmers or others,\" he said.\\n\\nNew dam plan angers farmers\\nFarmers are angry over plans for a big new dam in south-east Queensland.\\nLandholders near Gympie are planning a campaign to try to force the State Government to scrap the idea, which involves the resumption of 900 properties.\\nThe dam is designed to fix the water crisis in the south-east corner of Queensland and will cover 7,500 hectares of prime farm land near Traveston Crossing on the Mary River.\\nOne of the region\\'s biggest dairy producers, John Cochrane, has just spent a million dollars upgrading his farm, which would end up 30 metres underwater.\\n\\nGinseng managed investment scheme wound up\\nTasmania\\'s ginseng managed investment scheme will be wound up, with a $5 million loss.\\nThere were hopes the scheme could be salvaged but they have been dashed by the poor performance of the ginseng farm near Richmond, in the state\\'s south.\\n\\nBuderim Ginger\\'s domestic sales drop 6pc\\nQueensland-based Buderim Ginger says the major supermarket\\'s push towards home brands has resulted in its first drop in domestic sales in 15 years.\\nThe company has announced a profit of $536,000 for last year, up 56 per cent.\\nExports have grown 10 per cent but chairman John Ruscoe says domestic sales have fallen away by 6 per cent.\\n\"The retailers are clearly trying to position their own house brands where they can at the most desirable places in the store, which means that our products really are competing with that,\" he said.\\n\\nWet season takes its toll on live cattle exports\\nThe Northern Territory\\'s protracted wet season is having a lasting impact on live cattle exports to South-East Asia.\\nFeedlots in Australia\\'s largest market, Indonesia, are less than half-full, with another 50,000 cattle needed.\\nStuart Kenny from the Territory Cattlemen\\'s Association says cattle prices in Indonesia have gone up but that has not slowed demand.\\n\"There has been more price rises over the last couple of weeks but our visitors are saying that the prices did not detract from the supply and that\\'s a good sign,\" he said.\\n\"I think the Indonesian economy is certainly sort of holding its own and we certainly look forward to seeing a good cattle season ahead for the NT cattle industry.\\n\\nTable grape exports resume to Indonesia\\nTable grape exporters have resumed trade with Indonesia after being shut out of the market last month.\\nIndonesia has imposed tough new quarantine protocols to reduce the threat of fruit fly, which the industry has branded unworkable.\\nSome companies have begun fumigating fruit with methyl bromide at a Melbourne facility to meet the new demands but Brett Pickering from exporter Best Fresh says it is not an ideal result.\\n\"There is an additional cost obviously for the treatment,\" he said.\\n\"In terms of shipping out of the country we lose a bit of flexibility in being able to utilise the Adelaide port for later leaving vessels.\\n\\nWA native title battle resolved\\nA 12-year native title battle surrounding the Western Australian town of Broome has finally been resolved.\\nThe Federal Court has recognised the Yawuru people as the rightful native title holders of land surrounding Broome.\\nThe full effect of native title will take place on the Indigenous-owned cattle property, Roebuck Station, while the neighbouring property, Thangoo Station, will continue to operate as a privately-owned lease.\\nFred Chaney from the Native Title Tribunal says the decision also extends to areas like the famous Cable Beach.\\n\"The beach is of course a very significant feature of Broome and that is an area where you can\\'t have exclusive possession the court found but where the Aboriginal people have continuing traditional interests which they share with the general community,\" he said.\\n\"There are areas of town where native title has been found to survive (in other words not extinguished) and there are very large areas outside town, in particular the Aboriginal owned pastoral property which has exclusive possession native title.\"\\n\\nPilbara pastoral strike anniversary remembered\\nIndigenous people in Western Australia\\'s north-west are commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Pilbara pastoral strike.\\nAboriginal pastoral workers walked off stations on May 1, 1946, demanding wages and better conditions.\\nFran Heintz from the Wanga Maya Aboriginal Language Centre says the event had a massive impact on Indigenous workers.\\n\"It\\'s been a fairly significant event for the region and in many ways we believe it\\'s a significant national event,\" he said.\\n\"Some people actually call it the black Eureka. It did set what\\'s been in place now for 60 years and that is the equal respect.\\n\\nCattlemen unable to find murdered teen\\nCattlemen in Victoria\\'s Barmah forest have been unable to assist police in finding a murdered teenager missing since April last year.\\nDetectives asked the cattlemen to keep an eye out during their annual muster at the weekend.\\nRaymond Allen, 17, from Mooroopna, is believed to have been killed and buried in the forest on the banks on the Murray River.\\nBut Kelvin Trickey from the Barmah Cattlemen\\'s Association says nothing was found.\\n\"We haven\\'t detected anything at all ... we\\'re always tracking for cattle, looking for foot marks and that all through the bush,\" he said.\\n\\nParade heralds start to mustering season\\nThe main streets of Alice Springs are closed today to pay tribute to the local cattle industry.\\nThe Bangtail parade celebrates the traditional start to the central Australian mustering season.\\nHistorically the May Day weekend was when cattle from stations around Alice Springs were marched through the streets to the year\\'s first sale.\\nToday there are no cattle in sight but the Alice Springs mayor will lead the parade watched by about 5,000 people as it makes its way through the centre of the town.\\nBut while Alice Springs is a hive of activity, it is somewhat more quiet on the stations.\\n\\nAthletic mare takes out campdraft comp\\nAn athletic mare called Roanys Chex, ridden by central Queenslander Pete Comiskey, has taken out Australia\\'s richest campdraft at Rockhampton.\\nRecord numbers of riders competed over the weekend in front of what organisers say was its biggest ever crowd.\\nMr Comiskey says his $20,000 share of the prizemoney will come in handy.\\n\"Most certainly there\\'s always plenty of costs in campdrafting,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s always a great honour to win the big one and this mare has been very successful for us, to win the clock last year and the Gold cup, and we\\'re very lucky to have her on the truck.\"\\n\\nSkilled migrants\\' minimum wage may hurt business\\nMeat processors say the Federal Government\\'s decision to set a new minimum wage for temporary migrant workers will hurt regional businesses.\\nWorkers on temporary visas will have to be paid a minimum of $42,000 a year after unions claimed local jobs were being undercut.\\nThe Federal Government says the decision is to help Australia compete against other nations in the fight to attract employees.\\nKevin Cottrill from the Meat Industry Council says while it will not stop employers from taking on migrant workers, it will add to costs.\\n\"The big risk I guess is that the expectation of current employees and of unions is that there might be a 7 per cent increase across the board in wages, that would be the big danger,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re looking at something in excess of 7 per cent which is a substantial increase given the current rates of inflation so it will certainly have an affect on the costs of the industry.\"\\n\\nRural students sought to fill mining job vacancies\\nThe education sector in South Australia will recruit students from rural areas to meet the needs of the state\\'s mining boom.\\nWith concerns over future labour shortages, a new degree in mining engineering will be offered at the University of Adelaide next year.\\nInaugural Professor of Mining Geology, Ian Plimer, says the new course will specifically seek students from outside the city.\\n\"We are really targeting students from the rural areas because the mining takes place in the rural areas,\" he said.\\n\\nAnimal rights group targets children in education campaign\\nAn animal rights group has announced plans to target 3 million children in 9,000 schools with a program it says teaches compassion and respect for animals.\\nVoiceless has launched its Animal Club project on the Internet, encouraging children to speak out against factory farming, live exports, and kangaroo culling.\\nEducation Manager Elaine Morris, says it is the first national animal education initiative for children.\\n\"All Animal Club really wants to do is just provide children with the opportunity to harness that natural empathy that most children have for animals, and look at them through a child\\'s eyes,\" she said.\\n\\nBlueprint targets strategies to combat rural suicides\\nThe Federal Government has been presented with a blueprint outlining 23 ways to ease the mental health crisis in regional Australia.\\nThe release of the blueprint marks the launch of the Rural Mental Health Network, a partnership of 19 stakeholders from New South Wales.\\nThe Rural Mental Health Network includes mental health support groups, charity organisations, government departments and farming representatives\\nThe network says male farmer deaths from suicide are double that of any other group in the population and is urging governments to take action saying the drought may end, but ramifications such as depression and financial hardship continue for many years.\\n\\nFarmer confidence falls as oil prices rise\\nHigh oil prices and rising Australian dollar have hurt confidence levels among farmers.\\nThe National Australia Bank\\'s agribusiness monitor shows more farmers reported poor conditions in the March quarter than in the December quarter, although they are generally optimistic about the longer term.\\n\\nMachinery demand falls in wake of low grain prices\\nLow grain prices are being blamed for a big drop off in demand for broadacre tractors and machinery over the past 12 months.\\nSales are booming in the sugar, dairy and horticulture sectors for smaller equipment, but Vin Delahunty from the Tractor and Machinery Association says grain farmers are holding off.\\n\"People who are relying on sales into the cropping areas have really struggled,\" she said.\\n\\nCanola growers may benefit from high oil price\\nThe high price of crude oil is causing plenty of headaches, but there could be a positive spin-off for canola growers.\\nEuropean countries and the US are focusing more attention on alternative ways of producing power.\\nDavid Syme from the Grain Pool in Western Australia says they will be looking for more canola.\\nParticularly in Germany, there\\'s quite a number of new biodiesel plants going up, and that\\'s of course consuming a lot of their rapeseed oil,\" he said.\\n\\nFertiliser supplier\\'s half-year profit rises\\nFertiliser supplier Incitec Pivot has reported a turnaround, posting a half-year profit of more than $27 million up

Australia\\'s iconic Goyder\\'s Line to shift 100 kilometres south.\\nThe imaginary line was drawn in 19th century by surveyor general George Goyder marking the 250 millimetre rainfall area from the Eyre Peninsula around to the Riverland.\\nHe believed the region north of the line should not be cropped.\\nPeter Hayman from the South Australian Research and Development Institute says with an increase in temperature and a reduction in rainfall, the line could shift as far south as the Clare Valley.\\n\"What we found was that the worst scenario, so the worst amount of warming and the most extreme scenario was for it to move by 2070 as far as as somewhere like Clare,\" he said.\\n\\nTurnbull hears river flow worries\\nThe Parliamentary Secretary responsible for water, Malcolm Turnbull, has entered the debate over cross-border water flows in the Condamine Balonne river system.\\nLandholders in north-western New South Wales have long complained they are missing out because Queensland irrigators are allegedly extracting too much water north of the border.\\nMr Turnbull met landholders yesterday and says while the Federal Government cannot force Queensland to change its water management policy, the problem must be addressed.\\n\"There is no question in my mind that when the allocations of water were made in Queensland over the last 2O to 30 years, little or no regard was had to the downstream consequences in New South Wales,\" he said.\\n\\nDam compo discussions too early, says minister\\nThe Queensland Government says it is too early to discuss compensation for farmers affected by a proposed new dam near Gympie, in the state\\'s south-east.\\nThe Government is planning to build a 660,000 megalitre dam on the Mary River, which would involve the resumption of 900 properties.\\nBut Water Minister Henry Palaszczuk says it will be a number of weeks before the Government decides if it will definitely go ahead with the plan.\\n\"Currently it\\'s under investigation but if the numbers stack up, of course that will become the site,\" he said.\\n\\nCommercial beekeepers close up shop\\nThe commercial beekeeping industry in the Northern Territory has decided to call it a day.\\nAfter the poorest season in memory involving floods, termites, cane toads and a depressed honey market, Kevin Eastburn from the NT Beekeepers\\' Association says they

sign for industry\\'\\nThere are changes under way in Australia\\'s pearling industry, with a major distributor and marketing company buying its first pearl farm.\\nThe Autore group has paid $15 million for Broome-based Clipper Pearls.\\nBrett McCallum from the Pearl Producers Association says after a tough few years in the sector, the deal has injected a bit of confidence in the

this industry,\" he said.\\n\\nTokyo restaurant to use Victorian produce\\nThe Bracks Government is backing a restaurant in Tokyo, which will offer food made entirely from Victorian produce.\\nLocally-grown beef, lettuce and olive oil will be among the ingredients on the menu at Hiroo 148.\\nRoss Clarke from the Department of Primary Industries says it is designed to help

is a real issue and communicating with importers about your product.\\n\\nBeef brand celebrates program benefits\\nThe benefits of marketing food from paddock to plate are being marked by the 10th birthday of one of Australia\\'s biggest beef brands.\\nCertified Australian Angus Beef began by supplying 12 steers for a Melbourne restaurant.\\nIt now kills 2,000 head of cattle a week, with 80 per

does not own an animal or a kilogram of beef,\" he said.\\n\\nResults of sheep pesticide review still some time away\\nIt will be several months before a report into the health effects of a common sheep pesticide are made public.\\nThe Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is conducting a review into diazinon, which is used to treat lice and flystrike in sheep, after its use caused serious health concerns for some rural workers.\\n\\nTests clear Australian wheat shipment\\nAuthorities in India have now cleared a shipment of Australian wheat, just two days after claiming it contained an unacceptable level of pesticide.\\nA second round of tests has found no contamination in the 50,000 tonne consignment, which is being unloaded at the port of Chennai.\\nAWB\\'s Peter McBride says the company is not yet sure what caused the mix-up.\\n\"AWB has been officially informed that the wheat has been fully cleared by Indian authorities and the shipment is currently unloading at Chennai in India,\" he said.\\n\"We had some meetings late yesterday, we\\'ll obviously have further meetings today but the good news is the wheat has been cleared.\"\\n\\nRates hike to hurt commodities outlook\\nThe Reserve Bank\\'s decision to lift interest rates is more bad news for farmers, following on from high fuel prices.\\nThe interest rate rise, to 5.75 per cent, is the first in more than 14 months.\\nSenior analyst with Hartleys, Rob Brierley, says the announcement will hurt the outlook for commodities.\\n\"Most of the commodities are priced in US dollars so it means that the seller of the commodity actually gets less in Australian dollars for it,\" he said.\\n\\nFarmers dispute Govt report figures\\nVegetable growers say the Federal Government has made up figures in a report, which shows extended country of origin food labelling would cost consumers $120 million a year.\\nFarmers want the labels on packaged and canned food as well as fresh produce to give consumers more information and promote locally grown fruit and vegetables.\\nBut the Government says the study shows the costs of the changes would far outweigh the benefits for both consumers and growers.\\nJohn Roach from grower group AusVeg says the study was based on flawed data.\\nBut while rejecting new laws to enforce more detailed labels, Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says he wants to change the Trade Practices Act to give consumers more accurate information.\\nHe says under the changes, \\'made in Australia\\' would be replaced for some packaged food to \\'grown in Australia\\'.\\n\\nFruit growers attend crisis summit\\nAustralia\\'s summerfruit industry is drafting an action plan to try to keep producers in business.\\nPeach, nectarine, plum, apricot and

Hutchinson admits there is bound to be scepticism.\\n\"And for some it\\'s going to be a leap of faith in what we can deliver, there\\'s no doubt about that,\" he said.\\n\\nUS producers implement animal ID system\\nUS Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns says major beef buyers have given the country little choice but to implement a national animal ID system.\\nThe National Animal Identification System could become compulsory if not enough US producers volunteer to join by 2009.\\nMr Johanns says in response to industry opponents of animal ID in US, major beef competitors Australia and Canada have already implemented systems to trace and contain disease outbreaks.\\nAnd most recently, Mr Johanns cited retail demand in Australia.\\n\"I just noticed that in Australia, a representative of McDonalds, which of course is a major purchaser of beef, made a statement about the need for this animal ID system.\"\\nMr Johanns predicted the US industry will have to change with the times, despite some who oppose new costs and less corporate privacy.\\n\\nRestraint boxes to improve cattle slaughter in SE Asia\\nAustralia is investing almost a million dollars to improve the slaughter of cattle in South-East Asia.\\nFifty restraint boxes are being installed at abattoirs across Indonesia and Malaysia.\\nThe aim is to ensure all Australian cattle are processed humanely within two years.\\nMeat and Livestock Australia\\'s Patrick Underwood says he is confident the boxes will be used.\\n\"It\\'s a fully galvanised and enclosed box, whereby the animal enters through a raceway into an abattoir, is placed in a restraining box and restrained prior to slaughter,\" he said.\\n\"I have formed an animal welfare task force, with members of APFINDO (the Indonesian feedlotters and farmers association), so the Indonesian importers are with us, illustrating the clear benefits of using these restraining boxes.\"\\n\\nBeef Australia under way in Rockhampton\\nAustralia\\'s biggest beef industry event is under way in central Queensland.\\nRockhampton hosts Beef Australia every three years, claiming it is the country\\'s beef capital.\\nFifty thousand people are in the city and over

successfully grow southern bluefin tuna cell cultures\\nIn a world first, South Australian scientists have grown cell cultures of the southern bluefin tuna.\\nFlinders University and the CSIRO have grown the cells so they can experiment with antioxidants to extend the shelf life of tuna and test for viruses.\\nDr Kathy Schuller from Flinders University says it is much cheaper than using live tuna worth $50 a kilogram.\\n\"We can test 24 different concentrations and combinations of antioxidants at a time,\" she said.\\n\\nUnwanted grapes to be used in non-alcoholic sparkling wine\\nA small

Sarah Fyffe has applied for a licence to use dingoes as sniffer dogs at the border and in bushland between Western Australia and the Northern Territory.\\nShe says dingoes are naturals for the outdoor job,\\n\"We\\'re not talking about working in a building, we\\'re not talking about working in an airport, we\\'re talking about working in rugged terrain,\" she said.\\n\"[It is] very unforgiving - and where\\'s the dingo from? That\\'s its natural habitat and they cope brilliantly with it and know how to handle the elements.\"\\n\\nBudget good news for rural Australians\\nThere is a fair bit of good news for rural Australia out of Treasurer Peter Costello\\'s 11th Budget.\\nThere is more than $2 billion in extra funding for roads and rail, money for the Murray River and a big crackdown on illegal fishing.\\nThere are also wide ranging tax cuts, which are supposed to leave more money in our pockets and changes to capital gains tax to make it easier for farmers to pass on their properties.\\nPresident of the National Farmers Federation Peter Corish is certainly happy.\\n\"This Budget is probably the most positive budget that Treasurer Costello has delivered for rural Australia,\" he said.\\n\"NFF had three major priorities leading into this Budget, the first one was sustainability, the second one was infrastructure and the third one was taxation relief for rural Australia.\\n\"And I can say that positively we\\'ve had movement on all three areas.\"\\nMore rural Australians will also be able to access the aged pension.\\nThere will also be incentives for farm and mining businesses to invest in new plant and equipment with changes to depreciation rates.\\nThere will also be around $50 million for extra mental health services in country areas.\\n\\nVaile starts Budget sell\\nThe Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Nationals, Mark Vaile, has been out this morning telling rural areas the Budget sets up the bush to take advantage of the current resources boom through big infrastructure spending.\\nHe is especially proud, as most National party members are, of the $2.4 billion in roads funding he says the Nationals have helped secure.\\n\"If you are talking about regional Australia, my view is one of the most important targeted components in this budget is that $307 million of extra money directed at local governments for local roads and bridges this year, they\\'re the important things to regional Australia,\" he said.\\nWhen Australia\\'s peak rural lobby group the National Farmers Federation says this is the best Budget in 11 years, that should not leave too much room for the Opposition to be critical.\\nBut that has not stopped Labor\\'s agriculture spokesman Gavan O\\'Connor describing the Budget as missed opportunities.\\nHis point is you can have all the new bitumen in world but if it is not too dear to drive on that bitumen because of high fuel prices and higher interest rates, well the big spending backfires.\\nHe is also talking up what he says is the Government\\'s failure to target its infrastructure spending, failure to address environmental issues and failure to ease skills shortages in regional areas.\\n\"No mention of the productivity challenge and no attempt to get on top of the foreign debt,\" he said.\\n\"No attempt to address the massive skills crisis in rural Australia and there\\'s no movement on the last great frontier for Australian agriculture that is the regeneration of our soils.\\n\"There is no attempt to engineer through these expenditures a new wave of research and innovation in the rural sector.\\n\"On that basis I think there will be some significant questions asked about this Budget.\"\\n\\nPunters\\nWhat do the punters think of the Budget?\\n\"For me, I\\'m in a retirement age so the amount that I can earn tax-free has gone up, the threshold there, so I think the threshold for low-income earners has been very good,\" one person said.\\n\"It\\'s quite encouraging about the water, that\\'s going to be the biggest problem and I think people in the towns have got to realise that they\\'ve got to pay more for their water and not be so greedy and they\\'ve got to do something about storage,\" another said.\\n\"I think the Budget lacks vision because it should have looked at the longer term infrastructure issues and I just think that politicians are driven by short term decision making all the time which we pay a big price for,\" a third person said.\\n\\nEconomist warns about spending\\nThe tax cuts are expected to ease pressure on rural households which have faced higher petrol prices and grocery bills in recent months.\\nThe experts say while the cuts will not put pressure on interest rates in the short term, there are no guarantees the Reserve Bank will not increase rates towards the end of the year.\\nANZ chief economist Saul Eslake says there are still reasons to be cautious about spending.\\n\"Even allowing for the fact that people in rural areas tend to drive longer distances than those in the city, the tax cuts are enough to offset the most recent roughly 10 cent a litre increase in petrol prices and the rise in interest rates,\" he said.\\n\"But any further rise in petrol prices or indeed in interest rates would probably be sufficient to eliminate the benefits of the Budget tax cut altogether.\"\\nMeanwhile Treasurer Peter Costello told a media conference yesterday the only way fuel prices will come down is if the cost of crude oil falls.\\nThere is more than $11 million allocated for two new studies on the use of biofuels but Greens Senator Christine Milne says Mr Costello is wasting his time spending up big on roads, when it is becoming too expensive to drive on them.\\n\"He\\'s about the only person in Australia who doesn\\'t see increasing oil prices as a major issue,\" she said.\\n\\nIndustry group concerned about lack of initiatives\\nThere is concern about a lack of initiatives in the Budget to improve the national skills base and tackle the labor shortage in Australia.\\nAlthough new measures have been announced to make it easier for overseas workers, the Australian Industry Group says the Budget should have made more progress in big nation building projects.\\nWhile happy with many of the initiatives announced for business and the road funding, Heather Ridout says there is a long way to go to provide the necessary infrastructure to improve productivity and cope with future demand.\\n\"I think that\\'s another area where there could have been more done,\" she said.\\n\"They\\'re certainly bringing forward some of the spending which is important, some increase in road funding but it needs a more coherent plan.\\n\"We still need better interaction between road and rail, I think we still need more of a national plan and that\\'s got to be really agreed between the states being very big spenders in this area.\\n\\nLittle in budget to encourage exploration, says mining group\\nThe WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy says there is little in the Budget to encourage exploration in the resources sector.\\nThe industry wants a flow-through shares scheme to boost exploration but did not have any joy last night.\\nChamber director David Parker says more needs to be done there as well.\\n\"This is something which industry has been arguing for a number of years,\" he said.\\n\"We see exploration as very much the future of the resources industry.\\n\"We are tending to rest on our laurels in terms of the future sustainability of the industry.\\n\"I think if you look at the medium to long term outlook for renewing Australia\\'s resources inventory we really are at cross roads.\\n\\nBudget fails to tackle climate change, green groups say\\nThe Federal Government has come under fire from green groups, which claim the Budget fails to tackle climate change.\\nThe major allocation in environmental spending is $500 million for the Murray Darling Basin Commission.\\nThat money will fund projects like salt interception schemes, fishways, local and weir upgrades, and possibly buying water from farmers.\\nSouth Australian River Murray Minister Karlene Maywald says the money has been desperately needed.\\n\"Projects were underfunded, the Murray Darling Basin Commission was underfunded, our projects that we all agreed to from a jurisdictional point of view were all starting to slip and it looked like we were never going to achieve what we needed to do to save the River Murray,\" she said.\\n\\nBudget boosts funding for illegal fishing fight\\nThe Federal Government has announced a big crack down on illegal fishing in Australia\\'s northern waters.\\nThe $389 million package is designed to double the number of boats apprehended each year through increased surveillance and patrols, along with improved boat-burning facilities to destroy illegal fishing boats.\\nIndigenous coastal rangers will also be employed as part of the plan but Gary Ward from the Gulf of Carpentaria Commercial Fishermen\\'s Association says the money is being used in the wrong way.\\n\"Spending this money on Aboriginal communities is very fine but you\\'re talking about a radius of probably 25 kilometres each side of the community,\" he said.\\n\"Now these boats range widely over the Gulf of Carpentaria, we need more surveillance but we need more active now, the fishing fraternity in the Gulf of Carpentaria that\\'s worked so hard for a sustainable and viable fishery has been left out in the lurch.\"\\n\\nPlan unveiled to secure veg industry future\\nA new $3 million strategy to secure the future of the vegetable industry has been unveiled in Brisbane this morning.\\nVegVision 2020 is the product of months of talks between growers, the Federal Government, supermarkets and food processors.\\nIt is a $3 million plan with a very simple message - how to lift the industry\\'s growth from an unsustainable 3 per cent by getting more vegetables on consumers\\' plates.\\nFair Dinkum Food Campaigner Richard Bovill is a member of the Australian Vegetable Industry Development Group and says growers must work with retailers and processors if they are to secure their future.\\n\"There are adversarial issues out there, there will always be competitive pressures but we also have to understand our common goals and work together with those,\" he said.\\n\"I think we can look to a range of different industry models and we shouldn\\'t just look at vegetables and the horticultural sector.\"\\n\\nUS Farm Bill debate begins\\nThe battle has started early in Washington over the next US Farm Bill, due to be drafted next year.\\nThe White House and Congress do not see eye to eye on farm policy.\\nWhile US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns and the White House are calling for sweeping changes in US farm policy, lawmakers are defending the status quo.\\nTop Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee Collin Peterson told a farm bill field hearing in Texas, US agriculture should not be singled out for cuts.\\n\"This budget talk irritates me a little bit because agriculture did not cause these budget problems. And I do not agree that we ought to be the ones that have to pay the price because we\\'ve actually saved money,\" he said.\\n\\nRow erupts between Grains Council and Agriculture Minister\\nA rift has emerged between Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran and Australia\\'s peak grain lobby.\\nThe Grains Council is outraged that the oil-for-food inquiry is being used as an excuse to backflip on plans to reduce a key levy for the Wheat Export Authority.\\nThe council wanted the industry levy reduced from 22 cents a tonne to 19, leaving the authority with a million dollar cash surplus.\\nSpokesman David Ginns says the surplus will now be doubled and has accused Mr McGauran of ignoring growers.\\n\"There have been a number of matters that we\\'ve raised with him where he hasn\\'t taken the advice of the key industry body and we are concerned that our batting average is not particularly good at the moment and we seem to be getting some excuses back at the moment,\" he said.\\nBut in an unprecedented attack on a peak commodity council, Mr McGauran has accused the Grains Council of acting dishonourably and not working in the best interests of growers.\\nMr McGauran says the council has also deliberately leaked confidential ministerial documents and spread misinformation.\\n\"I believe this is an ill-considered and ill-timed intervention by the Grains Council which is more puzzling than anything else,\" he said.\\n\\nSaltbush shrubland plan angers graziers\\nGraziers in western New South Wales are furious about a proposal to list old man saltbush shrubland as endangered.\\nThe New South Wales Scientific Committee has found saltbush shrubland has fallen by 70 per cent since European settlement and the rest is at risk of extinction from clearing and grazing.\\nBut Graham Morphett, who has a property north-west of Hay, says the plant is thriving in the western division due to good management and rabbit control.\\n\"I\\'ve got 170,000 acres out here and I have tens of thousands of acres of old man saltbush with up to 5,000 acre stands,\" he said.\\n\\nCalls to scrap WET tax\\nThe Western Australian wine industry wants the Wine Equalisation Tax (WET) abolished despite a big Budget boost.\\nThe Federal Government has increased tax rebates to smaller wine producers by $210,000.\\nThey are available to producers with up to $1.7 million in sales.\\nBut Ron Fraser from the Margaret River Wine Association says it is band-aid therapy, which is lulling smaller producers into a false sense of security\\n\"It\\'s avoiding the issue that the WET tax is an impost on the cost of wine and should be scrapped altogether,\" he said.\\n\"The only way that you can get the benefits from this extra threshold is to increase your sales and in today\\'s market to increase your sales is an increasingly difficult job.\\n\\nGrape growers mull mothballing vines\\nGrape growers in South Australia\\'s Riverland are considering mothballing their vines, hoping to ride out the industry\\'s oversupply.\\nMany local growers could not sell their fruit this year, with wineries suspending or not renewing contracts.\\nWith no relief in sight, growers say they could prune heavily or use chemicals to hinder fruit growth to hibernate vines instead of having to pull them out.\\nBerri grape grower Bill Ruediger says he will have to make a decision very soon.\\n\\nACCC to investigate Sunbeam price-setting\\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will investigate whether dried fruit processor Sunbeam Foods breached the Trade Practices Act in setting low prices this season.\\nACCC Commissioner John Martin held talks with growers in Mildura in north-west Victoria this week after the Victorian Farmers Federation lodged complaints of unconscionable conduct by the industry\\'s major processor.\\nGrowers claim Sunbeam is taking advantage of its virtual monopoly position in the industry, and has set prices at a 20-year low.\\n\\nRural property values tipped to even out\\nRural property values have doubled and in some cases tripled in just four years, outperforming most other capital investments.\\nBut they could be about to come off the boil.\\nWayne Carlson from the National Australia Bank says prices are expected to even out in the next 12 to 24 months.\\n\"We probably don\\'t really expect prices to come down,\" he said.\\n\"We expect more a plateau effect.\\n\"These may be some discount in the lower, standard and marginal type lends. And there\\'s no doubt the trend of this off-farm investment super funds, managed investment schemes et cetera will continue to tip money into this market.\\n\\nPlantation tax reform plans unveiled\\nThe Federal Government has unveiled proposed changes to tax incentives for investors in the plantation timber sector.\\nThe incentives, which currently provide 100 per cent tax deductions for managed investment schemes, have been under review for the past 12 months.\\nDr Judy Clark, from the Australian National University (ANU), says the draft changes which will affect investor interest.\\n\"Putting a cap on the immediate volume of money that can be tax deducted and you also add on that reduction in top marginal tax rat from 47 to 45 per cent, both of these work to down play the attractiveness of these schemes for investors,\" she said.\\n\"We don\\'t need to plant more softwood to meet Australia\\'s entire timber needs.\\n\\nMarine park boundaries \\'botched\\'\\nThe Marine Conservation Society (MCS) wants changes to the way boundaries are established for national marine parks.\\nIt says the new park between Tasmania and the mainland is a botched job, which fails to protect marine biodiversity.\\nThe park\\'s boundaries were redrawn after concerns from the fishing sector.\\nThe MCS\\'s Craig Bohm says the revised boundaries have missed biodiverisity hotspots, and the Federal Government must review the process.\\n\\nG-G heads up Birdsville Track\\nGovernor-General Michael Jeffrey has embarked on a journey up the Birdsville Track to attract attention to life in the outback.\\nAccompanied by his valet, doctor, physio and other escorts, the Governor-General will spend five days meeting people from remote communities as part of the Year of the Outback.\\nMajor-General Jeffrey hopes the trip will inspire others.\\n\"I hope to expose the characters the lifestyle, some of the difficulties of course,\" he said.\\n\\nLeaping croc shocks scientists\\nAn airborne four-metre crocodile has made scientists\\' hearts skip a beat during research on the Ord River in the far north of Western Australia.\\nScientists had been using an electrical current to temporarily stun fish, so as to study them.\\nBut they accidentally sent a shock wave through a nearby crocodile.\\nScott Goodson from the Department of Environment says the jumping croc gave everyone a start.\\n\"He breached the water, he got a metre out of the water, that\\'s a big croc!\" he said.\\n\"He got a fairly good tickle up, I would have thought!\"\\nMr Goodson says the reptile is probably just a bit stunned after the accidental shock treatment.\\n\"He\\'s probably taken off and just kicking back behind another rock, I don\\'t think he will come too close to that boat again,\" he said.\\n\\nAWB hopes to salvage India wheat deal\\nWheat exporter AWB hopes last minute talks can salvage a half million tonne wheat deal with India.\\nIndian authorities have raised new concerns about quality issues, this time with wheat which has not even left Australia.\\nThe first consignment of wheat under the deal was held up last week while tests for pesticide contamination were carried out.

used his Budget reply speech to criticise the Government for basing roads spending on shoring up National party votes.\\nMr Beazley says Labor would provide free Tafe for traditional trades, more

The gall flies survived through the dry season and are growing here now.\\n\\nTassie farmer recognised by vege industry\\nA Tasmanian potato farmer has been named the Young Vegetable Grower of the Year, for his leadership during the Fair Dinkum Food campaign.\\nMatthew Ryan from northern Tasmania was honoured at the national conference of AusVeg in Brisbane at the weekend.\\nHe says the campaign raised the profile of the vegetable industry, but there is still more to be done.\\n\\nRoyal Flying Doctor Service turns 78\\nThe Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) is celebrating its 78th birthday today.\\nReverend John Flynn established the Flying Doctors at Cloncurry in north-west Queensland back in 1928.\\nSenior flight nurse at the Mount Isa base, Mary Noon, says the RFDS has come a long way since then, but still plays an essential role in remote areas.\\n\"One day you can be delivering a baby, and the next day you\\'re helping somebody with chest pain, so it\\'s a huge variation,\" she said.\\n\"You get to meet such a variety of people, you get to see new places, different places every day as opposed to the ward.\\n\\nMining losses a correction, say analysts\\nThe mining sector has had a rough couple of days, with metal prices falling sharply on the commodity markets overnight.\\nCopper was the biggest loser, at one stage falling 9 per cent, with gold down 4 per cent, and silver 5 per cent.\\nBut analysts say it is not a global market meltdown, merely a long overdue correction on the minerals boom.\\nMalcolm Condie, from AWB Landmark, says the mining sector has taken the biggest battering, and agricultural commodities should escape relatively unscathed.\\nHe says the fundamentals for wool prices are unchanged, the poor US crop has strengthened wheat prices and demand from Asia and India for other agricultural commodities will continue to strengthen.\\n\"I don\\'t see any further risk or downside risk for wool at this stage,\" he said.\\n\"We might see the market just tread water for a little while now.\\n\"Obviously grain, wheat is on a bit of an upward spiral and I mean generally there is no correlation between those and the other mineral commodities that we export. But obviously as far as food stuffs go people have to eat and I think we are going to see a lot more going into Asia.\"\\nRising inflation fears in the US have largely contributed to the weaker commodity prices.\\nThe All Ordinaries Index had fallen 93 points at the close of trade yesterday, with bulk-commodity companies like BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto the hardest hit.\\nChris Monroe of Hartleys says it was the correction the market, \"had to have.\"\\n\"Another cliche, the market was, \"priced to perfection\" I think,\" he said.\\n\\nNFF contender seeks to build trust between cities and bush\\nThe man widely tipped to be the next head of the National Farmers Federation (NFF) says his main priority will be rebuilding trust between urban and country areas.\\nThe former chairman of Meat and Livestock Australia David Crombie, has been asked to run for the NFF presidency by two state farming groups.\\nHe says farmers need the support of city people to defeat extreme animal rights groups, which he says is a key issue for Australian agriculture.\\nMr Crombie, who lives in Brisbane, says he is not a typical farmer, but does not think that stops him being an effective leader of Australia\\'s most powerful rural lobby group.\\n\"No, I\\'m certainly not an average farmer because I currently live in Brisbane, but certainly my interests are in agriculture and all of my professional life I\\'ve been involved in agriculture. I believe I have something to offer. I believe I can make a difference,\" he said.\\n\\nNSW farmers chief quits\\nThe chief executive of the New South Wales Farmers Association has resigned, effective immediately.\\nDr Ray Johnson has completed only two years of his three year contract, but the association will not say whether he will be paid out.\\nPresident Jock Laurie rejects suggestions the former chief executive was pushed by a divided board.\\n\\nCool reaction to Qld water plan\\nThe Queensland Government is looking to buy two large cotton properties in the state\\'s south-west to return water to the Murray-Darling Basin.\\nThe buy-up is expected to cost up to $60 million and deliver 58,000 megalitres of water a year over the New South Wales border.\\nThe Federal Government rejected a similar proposal four years ago to purchase the huge Cubbie Station.\\nGrazier Pot Peterson is among New South Wales landholders who have been critical of the amount of water Queensland irrigators take out of the Condamine-Balonne river system, and says this plan will not be very beneficial.\\n\"I\\'m not saying that they shouldn\\'t purchase it, but I just think it would be far more beneficial if they purchased something upstream that would have a big affect on us, because really the water virtually stops at Cubbie,\" he said.\\n\"As we saw in the 2004 flood they did have a big flood at St George but we didn\\'t get any of it here.\"\\nThe plan will be out to the Murray-Darling Ministerial Council meeting in Melbourne on Friday.\\nMeanwhile the Cubbie Group, which runs Cubbie Station, has slammed calls by the New South Wales Government for its water allocation to be reduced.\\nThe station can store 500,000 megalitres of water for its cotton-growing operation, and graziers south of the border complain they are being starved of crucial flood water flows.\\nBut joint managing director John Grabbe says New South Wales should fix up evaporation losses in the Menindee Lakes in the state\\'s west, before attacking Queensland\\'s science-based water allocations.\\n\"Oh get your own house in order, but let\\'s be fair dinkum, not just throw stones at each other, but let\\'s be fair dinkum,\" he said.\\n\"I mean, water is too valuable a resource to be going up into the air in shallow storage systems. Now we don\\'t do it at Cubbie, and I implore the southern states to seriously look at their storage systems.\\nFederal Agricultural Minister Peter McGauran says the CSIRO is scare-mongering, with a report calling for bigger environmental flows for the Murray River.\\nAn extra 500 gigalitres has already been committed to the Murray, but the scientific body says up to five times more will be needed to restore the river\\'s health.\\nDespite criticising that finding, Mr McGauran acknowledges progress has been slow on the Living Murray Initiative, and says the report will be considered.\\n\\nEldest children not always the best farm managers: research\\nNew research has shown the tradition of passing the farm onto the eldest child could be costing the sector its best talent.\\nPsychologist and social researcher, Dr Ian Ploughman, says by nature, older children are more conservative.\\nHe says younger siblings tend to be the most innovative and creative, but do not have the opportunity to contribute.\\n\"The younger brothers and sisters commonly have less interest in staying on the farm, and are more creative and more mobile,\" he said.\\n\\nDebt an obstacle to wool merger\\nThe wool industry remains committed to a merger between its promotion and research arms, despite a dispute over a $27 million debt.\\nAustralian Wool Services, which owns the Woolmark brand, is seeking financial help from the Federal Government to pay the debt, without success.\\nThe owed money relates to a pension fund for former UK-based employees.\\nChairman of Australian Wool Innovation Ian McLachlan says he understands the Government\\'s position, but there will not be a merger between the two companies until the bill is paid.\\n\"I\\'ve been in government and I think when a government has a position, it has to repeat that position, and it will hold that position until somebody comes up with a really bright idea as to how we can solve it,\" he said.\\n\\nAWB searches for new market for stranded wheat\\nWheat exporter AWB says it is trying to find another market for a shipment of wheat stranded at Geraldton in Western Australia, due to a quarantine dispute with India.\\nThe ship has been docked for a month, while talks have been under way to resolve the problem.\\nThe ship is expected to be loaded today.\\nPaul Ryan, AWB\\'s industry relations manager in WA, says two other vessels have been unloaded successfully in India, but he cannot say why this vessel has been in port for so long.\\n\"It is more to do with a range of quarantine restrictions, in terms of bringing wheat into India,\" he said.\\n\\nWA exercise to test response to foot and mouth outbreak\\nAn operation dubbed \"Exercise Wild West\" starts today in Western Australia to test the ability of authorities to fight a foot and mouth disease outbreak.\\nThe simulated exercise will run until Friday, and involves 180 people from the Department of Agriculture and Food and other agencies.\\nDirector of Animal Biosecurity Ashley Mercy says an outbreak in Australia similar to the 2001 United Kingdom outbreak would cost the Australian economy about $15 billion.\\n\\nNorthern growers put price cap on bananas\\nIt is pretty rare for producers to knock back money, but with soaring prices a small group of north Queensland banana growers have decided to put a price cap on their fruit.\\nPacific Coast Eco Bananas, which won an award last night for farming in an environmentally sustainable manner, says sustainability needs to apply to all sectors of the business.\\nIn the wake of cyclone Larry some bananas have sold for more than $100 a carton, but the company\\'s Dianne Sciacca says that level cannot be sustained, with the price cap set at $70.\\n\"I think if you\\'re serious about sustainability, you have to live within a sustainable business environment as well and we ask a premium price for our product of which that is supported by the supermarkets and our customers in the market place,\" she said.\\n\\nScientists consider climate change challenges\\nScientists are meeting in Sydney today to tackle climate change.\\nThe scientists from CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and the Greenhouse Office are debating strategies they say need to be implemented to adapt to the changing climate.\\nPrincipal scientist with the CSIRO, Kevin Hennessy says it is likely farmers will be forced to make big changes.\\n\"We would need to look at improving water use efficiency, water recycling, so reduce the amount of evaporation from some of our irrigation channels, and smarter ways of farming, for example direct drilling of seeds, retaining the stubble to reduce both erosion and water usage, and I guess some challenges for the types of crops that we use,\" he said.\\n\\nLand use bid concerns fishing industry\\nMembers of the aquaculture and fishing industries on South Australia\\'s Eyre Peninsula say they are worried about the possible impact of Aboriginal claims over the region\\'s coastal waters.\\nNegotiations have begun for Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUA), covering coastal land and waters from Cowell to Venus Bay.\\nMichael Whillas from the Seafood Council of South Australia says because the process is new, there are uncertainties about the future legal status of aquaculture leases and fishing rights.\\n\"The problem that we face is that under the Native Title Act, a native title claim is extinguished when there is an existing licence or lease,\" he said.\\n\"Under the ILUA, that doesn\\'t necessarily happen. At this stage, there are some grey areas.\\n\\nGroup opposes giving national parks back to traditional owners\\nA campaign to prevent 17 national parks being returned to their traditional owners has stepped up in the Northern Territory.\\nThe Territory Government intends to hand over the land title to traditional Indigenous owners, and then lease it back for 99 years under a joint management plan.\\nWith plans to circulate petitions, Save Our Parks campaigner Francoises Builder says there is plenty of opposition to any single group owning parks.\\n\"Parks are free, they are for everybody, so why handing it to a group of people and then leasing it back with taxpayers\\' money for a million dollars a year?\"\\n\"And it is true when you are giving away for example Bondi Beach it\\'s exactly the same thing, we have nothing else to go to.\"\\n\\nInfrastructure costs hold up Ord irrigation scheme\\nInfrastructure costs are the latest hurdle for expansion plans in the nation\\'s biggest irrigation scheme, in Western Australia\\'s far north.\\nNative title settlement last October raised hopes of a quick go-ahead for Ord Stage 2 but six months on there is still no movement.\\nThe scheme would more than double the existing irrigation area in WA, with more than 30,000 hectares earmarked for development.\\nWA\\'s Minister for Agriculture and Food Kim Chance says a decision is imminent, but it is a matter of deciding how much should be paid for roads, power and irrigation works.\\n\\nWA to reap rewards after Brazil iron deal\\nWestern Australia\\'s economy looks set for further growth, with Brazil, the world\\'s largest iron ore producer, negotiating a better-than-expected price hike.\\nThe market had tipped a rise in the iron ore price of between 10 and 15 per cent, instead, it will go up 19 per cent.\\nThe deal between Brazil\\'s CVRD and German steel-maker ThyssenKrupp sets the scene for increased iron prices for WA miners.\\nANZ Bank commodity analyst Andrew Harrington says it also means more royalties for government coffers.\\n\"The higher the price the higher the volume, will inevitably lead to higher tax revenues for the Government,\" he said.\\n\"Earlier in the year ABARE was forecasting that iron ore would become the highest exporter earner for the country.\\n\\nTasmania set for rail upgrade\\nToll\\'s successful takeover of transport company Patrick has paved the way for a multi-million dollar rail upgrade in Tasmania.\\nPacific National, which is jointly owned by the two companies, threatened to stop carting container freight by rail last year, unless state and federal governments helped to improve infrastructure.\\nAfter months of stalled negotiations, Pacific National has now agreed to invest $38 million in new rolling stock, while the governments will provide $118 million for infrastructure.\\nTasmanian Minister for Infrastructure Jim Cox hopes industry will also support a better rail service.\\n\\nDraft dairy report recommends support for GM crops\\nThe dairy industry has been embarrassed by the leaking of a draft report that recommends it join other agricultural industries in supporting genetically modified (GM) crops.\\nUntil now state governments have had the backing of the dairy industry in banning commercial GM crops.\\nThe draft report was commissioned by the Australian Dairy Industry Council (ADIC) and was not due to be released until much later this year.\\nPolicy director with Australian Dairy Farmers, Robert Poole, says the current policy was written seven years ago, and was due for review.\\n\"Had we not had it happen where it\\'s now become public we would have certainly gone to the point where we would have consulted widely especially with dairy farmers and with dairy companies, although they\\'re part of the ADIC process and obviously ultimately governments as well,\" he said.\\nMr Poole says it is a draft report and not industry policy.\\nMeanwhile a leading plant breeder says the dairy industry would save millions of dollars, if it embraced GM crops.\\nViruses in pastures such as white clover cost the industry $110 million a year, but a virus-resistant clover could be on-farm by 2009.\\nResearch director Professor German Spangenberg says that is just one reason for introducing genetically modified technology.\\n\\nBush sees no need for US inquiry into AWB\\nPresident George W Bush does not appear to think there will be need for a US inquiry into AWB, despite pressure from domestic farm groups and some senators.\\nThe President has expressed confident in the Australian Government\\'s ability to investigate the kickbacks scandal, during a visit to Washington by Prime Minister John Howard.\\nMr Bush praised Howard for his free trade efforts, and dodged questions about the AWB, saying Australia was conducting its own investigation into the UN oil-for-food scandal, and Mr Bush looked forward to seeing the results.\\nAt the US Capitol, Mr Howard told Senate leaders he understood the difficulty surrounding the Australia-US free trade agreement.\\n\"I know that things of that kind always create some difficult domestic judgments and considerations ... and, I\\'m very grateful that it received such strong support,\" he said.\\n\\nCourt rules against AWB over \\'apology\\' document\\nA Federal Court judge has ruled against wheat exporter AWB, in its fight to keep a so-called apology document confidential.\\nThe document was prepared on the advice of US-based public relations consultant, and was mistakenly included in evidence AWB tendered to the Cole inquiry.\\nJustice Neil Young took just 10 minutes to rule, AWB had no claim for legal professional privilege, and rejected the company\\'s efforts to keep the document confidential.\\nJustice Young also found Commissioner Cole had every right to rule on the legal status of the document, a point disputed by AWB.\\n\\nBurgess makes case to lead NFF\\nNo surprises and no big policy changes is how prospective National Farmers\\' Federation (NFF) boss Allan Burgess, says he will lead the organisation if elected president.\\nMr Burgess, NFF\\'s trade representative, will contest next month\\'s leadership ballot against former Meat and Livestock Australia boss David Crombie.\\nThe Victorian says making sure farmers get a fair price for their produce and maintain a good relationship with urban Australia are key issues.\\nHe says bringing Western Australia and South Australia back into the NFF fold is also high on his list of priorities.\\n\"At the very highest priority for Allan Burgess in any organisation he\\'s ever been a part of has been about getting a collective view,\" he said.\\n\"In my experience farm organisations only work well when you can come to one consensus.\\n\\nInquiry releases AWB apology\\nThe head of the Oil for Food Inquiry, Commissioner Terence Cole has just released the apology document, prepared between AWB, company lawyers and US public relations consultant Dr Peter Sandman.\\nThe document, drafted by former MD Andrew Lindberg, states that AWB accepts in paying money for inland transportation and after sales service, it paid money to the Iraq government in contravention of the UN sanctions.\\nThe document also states that although there were warning signs, AWB did not challenge the payments and for this they are truly sorry, and deeply regrets any damage this may have caused to Australia\\'s trading reputation, the Australian Government or the United Nations.\\nThe statement admits they failed to consider the implications of UN sanctions, and should have had their own internal systems of checks and balances to stop any abuse of the oil for food program.\\nIt concludes there is no excuse for what happened, that the company simply should have done better, and that Mr Lindberg is deeply sorry that it did not.\\nAWB had decided not to release the document, but it was mistakenly tendered to the Cole Inquiry, along with other AWB evidence.\\n\\nLive trade to Egypt may re-start soon\\nThe Federal Government has confirmed it is working on a plan which could see the livestock export trade to Egypt reopen in a matter of weeks.\\nThe trade to Egypt was banned in February when the 60 Minutes program aired footage showing animals being treated outside industry standards.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran says his investigations proved the cattle were not Australian, but he shut the trade because the humane handling of Australian animals could not be guaranteed.\\nThe Minister now says industry is forming a plan which will animals treated better.\\n\"There may well be some Australian stockmen or vets or locally employed and trusted staff,\" he said.\\nBut RSPCA National President Hugh Wirth says more than increased supervision is needed.\\n\"You can do all the supervising you like, it\\'s not going to change the fact that the abattoir workers have a great deal of difficulty dealing with Australian cattle.\"\\nAround 12,000 head of cattle were exported to Egypt last year worth around $10 million.\\nThe cattle industry says the findings of a new report add weight to the argument to resume the live cattle trade with Egypt, with appropriate monitoring.\\nCameron Hall from Livecorp says the report has found Australia has the highest animal welfare standards in the world.\\n\"There needs to be appropriate systems and appropriate monitoring to ensure some of the reasons that the trade was halted and suspended in the first place, cannot continue and particularly we can guarantee levels of assurance that the animals that we market into those countries are processed and handled with a level of care that we would expect,\" he said.\\nThe report was commissioned by Livecorp and Meat and Livestock Australia.\\nThe first shipment of live cattle out of the far north Queensland city of Townsville in three years is due to leave at the weekend.\\n\\nBoom time for feedlots\\nStrong export demand and the ongoing drought have pushed the feedlot sector to record heights.\\nAustralia now has just under 900,000 head of cattle on feed, with Queensland and Western Australia recording the biggest jumps.\\nBut Malcolm Foster from the Lotfeeders Association has sounded a note of caution.\\nHe says the United States could be back supplying beef into Japan and Korea as early as next month, which will provide stiff competition for our grain-fed product.\\n\"It is very good news, but this situation\\'s been going on now for two years,\" he said.\\n\\nReport recommends GM grass for dairy cows\\nThe South Australian Dairyfarmers Association says it will support the introduction of genetically modified (GM) pasture grasses if consumers accept them.\\nA leaked draft report for the Australian Dairy Industry Council recommends introducing GM grass for dairy cows, after research pointing to massive productivity gains from the new technology.\\nSA association president, David Basham, says the industry needs to do more investigation.\\n\"We need to keep that research going, we need to make sure that if consumers are ready to move on, we are there ready to adopt,\" he said.\\n\"If the markets are not willing to accept GM products then we as an industry can\\'t accept it and that may be the way it goes.\"\\nAnd there are deeply divided views on GM pastures in Victoria.\\n\\nConcerns over inferior wool in bales\\nConcerns have been raised about the growing number of wool bales that have inferior quality wool deliberately hidden in them.\\nThe Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) says buyers are losing confidence in the quality of Australian wool because of falsely presented bales and a rise in contaminated and unprepared fleeces.\\nAWEX woolclasser registrar Greg Sawyer says the market slump has seen growers trying to cut corners, but it is turning buyers off altogether.\\n\"We know of mills around the world that have notified AWEX of wools that for arguments sake may have 10-bale line of fleece wool, eight bales are well prepared and the last two bales may be topped up with inferior wool which hasn\\'t been,\" he said.\\n\\nNLIS frustration in Tas\\nTasmanian cattle producers are frustrated by the state\\'s roll-out of the National Livestock Identification System.\\nThey are still required to use tailtags, as well as the new electronic ear tags, even though the rest of Australia will be tail-tag free from July 1.\\nTasmanian NLIS coordinator John Cameron says they need to be able to guarantee trace-back to the last property of origin before tail tags can be removed.\\n\"At the moment there are still a lot of cattle with NLIS tags in their ears that are not registered to the correct property on the database,\" he said.\\n\"So if they\\'re sent to a saleyard or abattoir the database doesn\\'t have the correct information about where they are.\\n\\nGovt assesses drought in NSW\\nThe ongoing impact of the drought is being assessed first hand in New South Wales by Federal Government assessors.\\nThe National Rural Advisory Council has embarked on an extensive tour of areas coming to the end of exceptional circumstances drought relief.\\nSheep specialist Doug Alcock has helped the council to understand the severity of the drought from Canberra south to the Alpine region.\\n\"Water is the biggest issue in terms of the effort and money that\\'s been put into infrastructure in terms of tanks and new bores and reticulation systems,\" he said.\\n\"People running polypipe anything up to a couple of kilometres just to get water into paddocks, it\\'s very expensive and heartbreaking in country that nobody has any living memory of ever going dry some of the springs.\"\\nCoastal farmers in the region are also being hit hard by drought.\\n\\nSick sheep seek out healthy food: research\\nScientists have known for a long time that sheep seek out foods to gather the nutrients they need, but new research suggests they can choose foods to cure illness.\\nCSIRO Livestock Industries in Western Australia believe sick sheep will search for plants that make them better.\\nIt is conducting a trial in WA\\'s wheatbelt to work out which plants are eaten by sheep to improve their health and production levels.\\nSenior research scientist Dr Dean Revell says down the track, farmers might even be able to incorporate \"medicinal paddocks\" into their farm management.\\n\"Maybe they have to have a continual exposure to these, so they have to be incorporated into the grazing base, the feed base,\" he said.\\n\"The former option is more attractive, where we can set up and manage a separate paddock and take them there when needed.\\n\\nWA imposes ban to stop virus\\nWestern Australia has banned any plant material from the east which could host the yellow leaf curl virus.\\nThe virus was found in tomato crops near Brisbane and Bundaberg last month.\\n\\nFiji looks to dairying\\nFiji is hoping for a boom in its dairy industry, as its dominant sugar industry faces a downturn.\\nA delegation has been touring dairy farms in Victoria this week to investigate alternative ways of farming.\\nUntil recently the European Union has given preferential market treatment to Fijian sugar, but with an EU restructure, it is becoming hard for sugar growers to stay in business.\\nEconomist with the Fijian Ministry of Agriculture Waisiici Gonemaituba thinks favourable rainfall conditions will be an advantage for dairy farmers.\\n\"We get rain nearly every two days which is good for pasture production and the dairy industry as a whole,\" he said.\\n\\nLandcare to honour Farley\\nThe Australian Landcare Council plans to pay tribute to co-founder Rick Farley by an annual award in his honour.\\nA former head of the National Farmers Federation, Mr Farley, as also instrumental in establishing the Landcare movement.\\nHe died on Saturday.\\nLandcare chairman Bobbie Brazil says the award will honour Mr Farley\\'s work and vision.\\n\\nWimmera farmers say AWB should have released apology letter sooner\\nWheat growers say AWB could have taken the heat of the accusations it had paid kickbacks to the former Iraqi Government, by publishing a letter of apology before the Oil for Food Inquiry.\\nThe Inquiry yesterday released a document prepared by former AWB managing director Andrew Lindberg in December, which said the company was truly sorry it did not challenge the payments, despite warning signs, and it should have done better.\\nFarmers in Victoria\\'s Wimmera region say by trying to block the letter\\'s release through the Federal Court, AWB has only raised further questions about what it was trying to hide.\\n\"I would have believed that if it had have been presenter prior to the Cole Inquiry it may have defused quite a lot of the heat and argument within the Cole Inquiry itself,\" one farmer said.\\n\"In hindsight AWB should have published a very similar letter, if not the same letter early on in the piece and the witch-hunt might not have gone on to the extent that it has,\" another farmer said.\\nA rural public relations consultant agrees that the apology document should have been released earlier.\\nMark Paterson from Currie Communications says it would have made a big difference to AWB\\'s reputation.\\n\"Looking at the draft statement of contrition, it\\'s an excellent letter of apology,\" he said.\\n\"Yes it admits guilt, but what it shows is that AWB is human, and at no point at any time during this whole process have they demonstrated any humility at all.\"\\nMeanwhile, eight wheat exporters, including Cargill, Glencorp and AWB have bid for the latest tender to supply 3 million tonnes of wheat to India.\\nAWB has confirmed it will make an offer to supply 1.2 million tonnes of the contract, while the other companies are believed to have offered for smaller amounts.\\n\\nStates debate Murray River funding allocation\\nThere has finally been some progress in efforts to establish a national water trading system.\\nThe eastern states appear to be trying to settle their differences over the future of water at a meeting of the Murray Darling Ministerial Council in Melbourne.\\nThe council is also debating how to carve up an extra $500 million in federal funding to improve the environmental health of the Murray River.\\nWhile there is yet to be a national agreement on how water may be bought back by government into the Murray system, the states are making some progress of their own.\\nVictoria and NSW have reached an in-principle deal to trade water which may be up and running by the end of the year.\\nWhile the details of exit fees and other costs are yet to be worked out, both states have agreed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission should review any deal to make sure it is fair for all sides.\\nVictoria and South Australia had already an agreement on water trading prior to today\\'s meeting.\\nDoug Miell from the New South Wales Irrigators Council, says the state has managed to convince Victoria and South Australia of the merits of a system of tagged trading.\\n\"We\\'ve got the water that Victoria and South Australia have really got their eyes on, so it\\'s simply a case of he who has the gold makes the rules,\" he said.\\n\\nIrrigator groups oppose Snowy Hydro sale\\nKey irrigator groups in southern New South Wales have withdrawn their support for the sale of the Snowy Hydro electric scheme.\\nThey are worried about a planned 10 per cent cap on individual shareholdings after the company is sold by the federal, New South Wales and Victorian governments.\\nGeorge Warne from Murray Irrigation says the proposed safeguards are not enough to protect the business from an international takeover.\\n\"I think one of the really big issues is the fact that Australia\\'s largest single stored water resources - the Snowy Hydro scheme and its operation and the timing of releases and the power that is generated from - it is going to leave government ownership and go into private hands,\" he said.\\n\"We thought they would dissipate that effect by having a maximum cap of 5 per cent or 10 per cent that any one party could own.\\n\\nAustralia to lead climate change deal negotiations\\nAustralia will lead negotiations on a new international climate change deal to replace the Kyoto protocol which is due to expire in 2012.\\nThe framework, to be co-developed with Germany and South Africa, will apply to almost 200 countries.\\nMick Keogh from the Australian Farm Institute says farmers have led the way in reducing greenhouse emissions and should not be further penalised.\\nHe says federal and state governments cannot take credit for work largely undertaken by farmers.\\n\"There is only one sector of the Australian economy that\\'s made a very significant contribution to the reduction in the growth of Australia\\'s greenhouse emissions and that is the farm sector,\" he said.\\n\\nSeven-day forecasts now available to regional areas\\nFarmers across Australia can now access seven-day forecasts from the weather bureau, as well as the traditional four-day advice.\\nWeek-long forecasts have been available to city dwellers for some time, but they have now been rolled out on a trial basis at 600 weather sites around Australia, including regional areas.\\nAnne Farrell from the Bureau of Meteorology in Brisbane says the forecasts have some shortcomings, but will be accurate for a range of factors.\\n\"Temperature-wise I think the performance is generally pretty good,\" she said.\\n\"Rainfall-wise there\\'s still a lot of work to be done to try and get higher reliability in that as we go further ahead in that seven-day outlook.\\n\"But it\\'s at the point that we think that there\\'s sufficient skill in that, that its worth putting it out there for the public to make use of.\"\\nThe seven-day forecasts will be available free of charge through a website called Australian\\n\\nRio Tinto sets new iron ore price benchmark\\nMining giant Rio Tinto has confirmed it will receive 19 per cent more this year for iron ore shipped from WA, making it the benchmark price for other deals.\\nThe deal between Japanese steel mills and Rio Tinto closely follows a similar deal between Germany and Brazil.\\n\\nResearch centres\\' economic benefits to be evaluated\\nAustralia\\'s Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) are under review again.\\nThe CRCs are partnerships between government, industry and scientific institutes, undertaking research and development.\\nTo ensure future funding, the economic benefits of individual programs and centres will now be evaluated but Tony Staley from the CRC Association says it is hard to estimate the value of agricultural research.\\n\"And happily the governments are prepared to fund the next part of this work to endeavour to get a real handle, as much as you can, on those cases where you\\'ve got thousands of farmers, thousands of small businesses implementing practices, that have been ... recommended and adopted by many many thousands of people and it\\'s very very hard to measure,\" he said.\\nMeanwhile there are calls to establish a co-operative research centre for small farms.\\nNorth west Victorian horticulturalist Jim Belbin says properties of between 10 and 30 acres are struggling to compete against much larger farms.\\nHe believes an organisation should examine which crops could be sustainably farmed on smaller holdings of land.\\n\"I am certain that there are crops that require intensive farming that are suitable to small holdings,\" he said.\\n\\nPyrethrum prices cut\\nTasmanian crop farmers have been dealt another blow, a cut in pyrethrum prices.\\nTasmania is the world\\'s second largest producer of the daisy, which is used to make natural insecticide.\\nGrowers group chairman Scott Langton says the 5 per cent price cut has been attributed to a world oversupply and is likely to halt further development.\\n\"What we\\'re really after is just a fair and equitable return so that we can still maintain forward advancement in technology so that we\\'re ready to take up new technology that comes on,\" he said.\\n\\nNSW Govt moves to recruit UK nurses\\nMore overseas trained nurses will soon be hitting Australia\\'s shores, this time from the UK.\\nThe New South Wales Government has adopted a recruitment program similar to one operating in Queensland.\\nA team is heading to the UK next week to hire 400 nurses, with another 600 being sought from Canada and other parts of Europe.\\nDr Ross Maxwell from the Rural Doctors Association says it is easier to check the qualifications rather than those of health professionals from Africa or India.\\nHowever he says this is not discrimination.\\n\"I would hope that\\'s not the case and I believe that there are sound reasons to target health professionals where you can be confident of their training,\" he said.\\n\\nThousands expected to flock to Fred\\'s Show\\nThe first agricultural show of the year in the Top End is expected to attract 30,000 people through the gates this weekend.\\nEquestrian events are already under way south of Darwin at the four-day Fred\\'s Pass Rural Show.\\nLast year 29,500 walked through the gates of the showgrounds, which are nestled amongst five acre rural blocks on Darwin City\\'s southern outskirts.\\nAnd this year, a steer auction is being held for the first time and the

SA\\nA mammal, similar to a sugar glider, has been found for the first time in the south-east of South Australia.\\nThe squirrel glider is a threatened species more commonly found in western Victorian woodlands and along the eastern seaboard.\\nSA Department of Environment ecologist Dan Harley says the discovery was made by a researcher at the Museum of South Australia, who thought she was looking at a collection of sugar gliders.\\n\"When she got to this handful of specimens from the Bordertown area, she got some really weird results and scratched her head and couldn\\'t work out what was going on,\" he said.\\n\\nFijians set sights on dairy industry\\nFiji is hoping for a boom in its dairy industry, as its dominant sugar industry faces a downturn.\\nA delegation has been touring dairy farms in Victoria this week to investigate alternative ways of farming .\\nUntil recently the European Union has given preferential market treatment to Fijian sugar but with an EU restructure, it is becoming hard for sugar growers to stay in business.\\nEconomist with the Fijian Ministry of Agriculture Waisiici Gonemaituba thinks favourable rainfall conditions will be an advantage for dairy farmers.\\n\"We get rain nearly every two days which is good for pasture production and the dairy industry as a whole,\" he said.\\n\\nHay export market strong\\nAustralia\\'s hay exports have reached record levels with stronger demand from Japan, Korea and Taiwan.\\nMurray Smith, from exporting company Balco Australia, says last year exports were valued at more than $200 million.\\nHe says Australia\\'s high quality product is highly sought after and the market is as strong as he has ever seen it.\\n\"If we look at our exports to seasonally adjusted year end of November 05, I think we\\'re up to 685,000 tonnes being exported out of Australia of cereal hay and straw and that\\'s a record as far as I\\'m concerned,\" he said.\\n\\nBirdsville Track pastoralists face continuing drought\\nAfter battling seven years of drought pastoralists on the Birdsville Track in South Australia are reaching breaking point.\\nSome have not had a decent drop of rain since July last year, forcing them to either sell or agist most of their cattle interstate.\\nShane Oldfield from Clayton Station says this is the worst he has ever seen it:\\n\"We always get drought\\'s in this country you know two, three years, four years is a real bad one - this is the daddy of them all,\" he said.\\n\\nIraq wheat deal collapses\\nA deal to sell 350,000 tonnes of Australian wheat to Iraq is off.\\nThe sale was brokered by the consortium Wheat Australia after Iraq announced it would no longer do business with AWB.\\nThe consortium involving ABB, Graincorp and CBH is blaming increased demands from the Iraqi Grains Board although it will not specify what they were.\\nIt has rejected suggestions its inexperience in Iraq was a factor or because the wheat came from AWB\\'s national pool.\\nSpokesman Rhys Ainsworth says the sale was not in the best interests of wheat growers.\\n\"There were a couple of commercial issues that Wheat Australia, given that Wheat Australia are negotiating on behalf of Australian wheat growers, weren\\'t able to agree to and unfortunately we weren\\'t able to broker a deal over the last eight to 10 weeks despite what have been very positive discussions,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re disappointed for Australian wheat growers.\\n\"Wheat Australia came together following the efforts of the Government to secure this opportunity.\\n\"Certainly several of the areas that we weren\\'t able to reach agreement on weren\\'t what you\\'d call common I suppose.\"\\nAWB, which has veto rights over export deals, says it will reconsider whether other companies can tackle the Iraq market.\\n\\nPrivate member\\'s bill\\nMeanwhile Liberal MP Wilson Tuckey says he will introduce a private member\\'s bill to Parliament to remove AWB\\'s ability to veto other companies from exporting wheat, if the Government does not.\\nMr Tuckey says it was highly predictable a deal would not be reached because the wheat wasn\\'t sold at \\'arms-length\\' from AWB.\\nHe says he will talk to the Australian Grain Exporters Association today to encourage its members to lodge wheat export applications for Iraq.\\nBut he says the Government must also act to reduce AWB\\'s power.\\n\"It\\'s now necessary that the Government in its ambition to ensure that the trade is maintained to go to Brooks Grain or one of the, as some refer to them, the foreign devils, be given every opportunity to see if they can stitch up a deal and it should be the Government\\'s, if necessary, urgent legislation to make sure that deliveries can be obtained,\" he said.\\n\\nAWB earnings\\nDespite a rocky few months, AWB is expected to post good half year earnings this week on the back of a solid wheat harvest.\\nAnalysts say the recent poor share price is due to speculation about the future of the single desk and not the company\\'s performance.\\nThere are also reports today that a major management shake-up could be announced, although the company is not commenting.\\nCommsec analyst Grant Saligari says those rumours have not been put to the market.\\n\"There\\'s been nothing flagged to us by the company at this stage that they will, but that\\'s a possibility,\" he said.\\n\"The underlying results should still be reasonably robust. There\\'s likely to be a number of one-off costs associated with the Cole inquiry, they\\'ll certainly impact the result.\\n\"It\\'s likely to be higher than the originally flagged cost, as long as the inquiry goes on, I guess they\\'ll continue to have those one-offs.\"\\nIn another development AWB is gaining a foothold in the dairy sector, announcing a deal between its Landmark company and New

homes.\\nThe plan involves Extel technology, which boosts the power of telephone exchanges by up to 20 kilometres.\\nBut Telstra is concerned that rival companies will be able to use the technology.\\nSpokeswoman Liz Jurman says there are also other problems with the rollout of Extel and the company is now looking at alternative ways of delivering broadband to rural and remote areas.\\n\"The extender can\\'t be used on individual customers you need to provide it where there are clusters of demand, so obviously that depends on customer demand, so we haven\\'t yet made a final decision on that product,\" she said.\\n\"And it\\'s important to understand this device is not the be all and end all for providing ADSL to customers.\\n\\nUS cattlemen losing confidence in Japanese market\\nThe US-based National Cattlemen\\'s Beef Association says it is losing confidence in the Japanese market with its refusal to set a timetable to reopen the beef trade.\\nSpokesman Jay Truitt says the US has done all it can to reassure Japan that American beef is safe.\\nBut Japanese authorities now want to do their own inspections of US meatworks after a prohibited shipment, including spinal bones, made it to Japan in January.\\nWhile he is still hoping for the market to reopen soon, Mr Truitt says Japan is a less reliable market for US producers.\\n\"Our focus in the future is going to be more towards Korea, existing markets like Mexico and Canada, frankly, which is the fourth largest existing market for the United States and other countries around the Pacific rim,\" he said.\\nDespite the uncertainty, some reports suggest Japan could resume imports of US beef in July.\\nFollowing talks last week, Japanese experts have reportedly told US authorities they are \"basically content\" with measures to protect shipments from mad cow disease.\\nMeat and Livestock Australia\\'s regional manager in Tokyo Samantha Jamieson says the July start date is sooner the expected but should not cause alarm for Australian producers.\\n\\nDemand for bananas prompts desperate measures\\nCompetition to find enough bananas is heating up in New South Wales as prices continue to hover well over $100 a carton.\\nBefore cyclone Larry wiped out the north Queensland crop, growers in New South Wales were receiving under $10 a carton.\\nCoffs Harbour grower Mick Gentle says growers are receiving constant phone calls from agents looking for more fruit and one has even bought a local plantation to ensure supply.\\n\\nChinese currency may push wool higher\\nThe wool market is hoping for further gains this week, boosted by a re-evaluation of the Chinese currency.\\nThe value of the yuan has been strengthened against the US dollar and wool market analysts say it is already being felt in Australia.\\nThe eastern market indicator rose 16 cents last week to close at 729 cents a kilogram clean.\\nLandmark\\'s Phil Speers says with the Chinese buying around 60 per cent of Australia\\'s total clip, there could be further price rises.\\n\"This obviously makes their currency more competitive against the Australian currency which is going to make it easier for them to come in and buy our wools,\" he said.\\n\\nWater deal will bring benefits, says commission chief\\nThe head of the Murray Darling Basin Commission is defending the impact of the new interstate water trading agreement.\\nVictoria, New South Wales and South Australia have signed a deal to trade water across state borders, while the Federal Government has signalled its interest in buying water for the environment.\\nChief executive Wendy Craik says while there are concerns about the social impact of water being sold out of communities, there are other benefits as well.\\n\"Yes, when water leaves an area often you know there may be an immediate impact and quite often yes they\\'re not positive but often new enterprises arise up in those areas from where the water\\'s gone because people have money that they didn\\'t otherwise have from selling their water entitlement,\" she said.\\n\\nWA farmers anxious for rain\\nGraingrowers in Western Australia are anxiously waiting for some substantial rainfall to come out of a cold front expected to pass through in the next two days.\\nAlong with many farmers in the east, growing in the northern agricultural regions have been dry sowing since March and are now starting to worry about the impact of the ongoing dry.\\nCSIRO plant scientist John Passioura says farmers underestimate how strong seeds really are.\\n\"If you have a false start and you get a bit of rain and the seed starts to swell up and so and it\\'s done all of the getting the machinery ready to go, the biochemical machinery, then, it will skip that phase when you get the next good rain,\" he said.\\n\\nDemand for alpaca wool increasing\\nIf you have got an alpaca or two running around the backyard, you are being urged to shear it and sell the fleece.\\nThe industry\\'s marketing body says there has been a big jump in demand for alpaca fibre which cannot be met.\\nJohn Bentley, from the Australian Alpaca Association, says because the animals are valued as pets, or guard animals, there is less focus on their fleece.\\n\"The value is still highly in the animal, which tends to make the fleece at this point in time, more a by-product, but we do have to get the product out there to the public, get them familiar with alpaca,\" he said.\\n\\nSexy smells may help trap toads\\nBottling up cane toads\\' sexual odours is the latest left-field idea to trap the noxious pest.\\nThe new research builds on a discovery that the pheromones excreted by a native male frog attracts female frogs at large.\\nDr Mike Tyler from the University of Adelaide says they are hoping cane toad smells will have a similar pulling power.\\n\"If it\\'s an attractant we would be able to attract perhaps females in such numbers that instead of having to go around and pick up one here and one there, we might be able to attract them together,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt optimistic contract changes could save wheat deal\\nThe Federal Government says a 350,000 tonne wheat deal between Australia and Iraq could be salvaged.\\nYesterday, the Wheat Australia consortium said it had failed to come to terms with Iraq and negotiations for the $90 million deal were over.\\nBut Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran believes Iraq is considering removing a clause in the contract which Wheat Australia had found unacceptable.\\n\"Negotiations are not necessarily over,\" he said. \"Wheat Australia is working very hard in the interests of growers to complete the sale.\"\\n\"They\\'ve taken a strong line in regard to one particular clause, which they believe would disadvantage commercially Australian growers and that\\'s entirely proper and the right thing for them to do, and it may well be that the Iraqi side is now reconsidering they\\'re insistence in the insertion of that particular clause.\"\\nBut wheat growers in Victoria say they are not surprised the deal has stalled.\\nWhile some say the contract tender should be opened to other companies, others believe it shows the single desk is the only successful system.\\n\"The world wheat market is the highest it has been for five years. We\\'ve got people out there wanting to pay a good price for our wheat yet we are not able to fix these deals,\" one wheat grower said.\\n\\nWheat futures near all-time highs\\nA global share market fall in mineral and energy stocks is having unexpected benefits for wheat prices, with futures markets at or near all-time highs.\\nAnalysts say speculative funds appear to be pouring money into wheat, as they turn away from oil, gold and copper.\\nWheat prices on the Chicago Futures Exchange rose again overnight, to around $AUD220 per tonne.\\nBrett Stevenson, from Market Check, says even better prices are being offered for wheat for March 2008 and 2009, and at around $250 a tonne, they are just below the 1995 record.\\n\"We are faced for the first time a situation where the forward prices three years in the future are at extraordinarily high levels, nearly records,\" Mr Brett Stevenson said.\\n\"We have got massive amounts of money invested into the metals. We think some of that money maybe coming in to the soft commodity funds in other words, wheat, you know, grains, that sort of thing.\\n\\nWeaker price for Indian wheat deal\\nDespite a boom in wheat futures and the lowest global wheat stocks in 25 years, Australian farmers are not getting top grain prices this season.\\nIn the latest deal, Australia is believed to have offered to sell wheat to India at a much lower price than its major competitors.\\nGrains analyst Malcolm Bartholomaeus says that is largely due to the practise of selling each year\\'s stocks, before the next season\\'s harvest.\\n\"While it may be tempting to hold wheat back against this rising market and achieve higher prices later in the year, the practise in Australia has really been to clear each crop before the next one comes in basically at whatever price,\" he said.\\n\"The storage and handling companies and growers get pretty cranky if we go into the next harvest with stocks still being held in the system and I guess if AWB think that to get rid of the wheat they need to push it out at lower prices, then that\\'s what they\\'re doing.\"\\n\\nContinuing bear market may lead to nervous investors\\nThe Australian Stock Exchange has begun trading marginally weaker, despite stronger commodity prices on the London Metal Exchange overnight.\\nIn 10 days the local market has dropped $80 billion, reacting to weakening metal prices.\\nAlthough many analysts say the market needed a correction, Hartleys resource expert Rob Brierley says investors will start to get nervous if this bear market continues.\\n\"Probably another week of this and people would be extremely worried,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt, Telstra assurances sought for 3G rollout\\nThe Federal Government is under pressure to regulate the rollout of Telstra\\'s new 3G mobile phone network, to make sure rural Australia is not disadvantaged when the current CDMA service is shutdown.\\nTelstra has promised it will not turn-off CDMA before January 2008, even if the 3G network has reached equivalent coverage before then.\\nBut in Senate Estimates hearings yesterday National Party Senator Fiona Nash told Telstra representatives, regional areas deserve more than just assurances from the phone company.\\n\"But what if I just take you back to the Extel example and early on in the desk top study and the work that had been done in terms on what could be rolled out technologically, and now it seems that, \\'oops that wasn\\'t quite right\\'? What I\\'m trying to make sure for those people that live out in regional Australia that we don\\'t get to the end of the rollout and hear from Telstra again, \\'oops we didn\\'t get that quite right\\'.\"\\n\\nRoad cuts \\'add to Wadeye violence\\'\\nPoor road infrastructure is said to have contributed to ongoing violence within the Northern Territory\\'s largest Indigenous

Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) to use a BHP Billiton railway in Western Australia\\'s Pilbara has failed.\\nWhile the line is owned by the mining giant, FMG has argued it should be allowed access to take advantage of the resources boom, instead of having to build another railway.\\nAfter years of debate, Treasurer Peter Costello was expected to make an announcement on the proposal yesterday but the deadline passed without comment.\\nFMG\\'s Julian Tapp says the company is looking at how it might appeal the decision, which is a blow for all small iron ore companies in the region.\\n\"We\\'ve

Industries Minister Ian Macdonald has spent the morning discussing the deteriorating conditions with his colleagues in Cabinet.\\n\\nRoma saleyard replaces stock ID equipment\\nAustralia\\'s biggest saleyard is changing its national livestock identification equipment but management denies that is because it is not efficient.\\nRun-through scanners were introduced at Roma in southern Queensland in July last year, to comply with the new animal traceback laws.\\nSince there there have been complaints of time delays and ongoing debate over whether the equipment or the agents are to blame.\\nRob Loughnan, from the saleyard\\'s board, says delays are an issue.\\nBut he says the main reason for the change is because the system cannot easily separate an individual beat from a herd.\\n\"The market research is telling us that very soon the buyers will be wanting to know if there is an animal in a particular pen that is not lifetime traceable and that\\'s not going to suit their requirements and that\\'s going to have to be highlighted,\" he said.\\n\\nStudy to consider wine industry\\'s future\\nIncreased domestic and international competition has prompted a new study into the future direction of the wine industry.\\nThe Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and the Winemakers Federation of Australia are conducting the state of the industry study, which is to be released next year.\\nBut the report will not offer short-term solutions for growers unable to sell their grapes.\\nThe federation\\'s Dominic Nolan says it is to protect the long-term future of the wine industry, and is not a knee-jerk reaction to the grape glut.\\n\"The decisions that we make about planting today really has an impact in five years\\' time or beyond,\" he said.\\n\"What we\\'re looking at is very much a strategic document, we\\'re talking what\\'s going to happen in the next 10 to 20 years.\\n\\nVet\\'s braham fertility research honoured\\nThe highest accolade in veterinary science has been awarded to a man partly responsible for the success of brahman cattle in northern Australia.\\nDr Keith Entwistle has been awarded the Gilruth Prize at the Australian Veterinary Association\\'s annual conference in Hobart this week.\\nHe says years of research with his colleagues helped to solve problems with cow and bull fertility, when the brahman breed was first introduced.\\n\"A lot of the research that we did over the last 30 years has certainly contributed to the wider use of the brahman,\" he said.\\n\\nAWB profit rises despite scandal\\nDespite the oil-for-food inquiry and a sliding share price, wheat handler AWB has delivered a strong half-year result.\\nAWB admits it is in a difficult operating environment but its profit is up 5 per cent to $86 million before tax.\\nProfits have been boosted by a strong performance from the national pool, as well as business outside the wheat trade.\\nThe Cole inquiry has cost almost $10 million so far.\\nThe final bill is expected to total $18 million, as long as there are no extensions.\\nWhile happy with the returns, chairman Brendan Stewart says the company is determined to restore its reputation.\\n\"I think what this demonstrates is that while we\\'re in challenging times, that AWB is a very resilient business and we\\'ve got a good foundation for the future,\" Mr Stewart said.\\nMr Stewart has reaffirmed the company\\'s plans to separate AWB Limited from its international export arm.\\n\"This is a clear direction from the board that we are prepared to make changes that deliver security and certainty to the single desk,\" he said.\\nAWB\\'s results also divulge a payout worth more than $1 million to former managing director Andrew Lindberg.\\nMr Stewart has refused to confirm any planned changes to management until after the Cole inquiry hands down its findings. \\n\\nNew documents\\nThe Cole inquiry will be able to scrutinise new documents from AWB,

the US Agriculture and State Departments to investigate the AWB and why the Bush Administration has brushed aside similar requests.\\nSenator Harkin\\'s spokesman Dave Townsend says what happened to the $200 million in alleged AWB kickbacks is a key issue.\\n\"Prior to the fall, those kickbacks were going to Saddam Hussein,\" he said.\\n\"While Hussein is no longer in power, Senator Harkin would like to know where that money was going ... and why, at the time, ... we weren\\'t about to figure out that those contracts still contained kickbacks.\"\\nMr Townsend says Senator Harkin wants the $220 million recovered and returned to the Iraqi people. \\n\\nWheat sales\\nThe scandal is continuing to affect Australia\\'s wheat trade with Iraq.\\nDespite Federal Government speculation that a

overseas abattoirs, to better manage the welfare of exported livestock.\\nNational president Dr Matt Makin says the treatment of Australian animals once they are unloaded in overseas ports is becoming an increasingly contentious part of the trade.\\nCattle exports to Egypt were suspended earlier this year, after mistreatment concerns were raised.\\nDr Makin says the Australian industry needs to take a greater role in managing animal welfare, not just in the lead up to and during export.\\n\"We\\'ve been in heavy discussions with industry and with the Government to push the concept of facility audits overseas,\" he said.\\n\\nAustralians to train Malaysian abattoir staff\\nThere is expected to be improved animal welfare standards at new cattle abattoir and training centre being

operational, at a time when gold prices are enjoying record highs.\\nThe gold mine is situated in the remote desert country between Halls Creek and Alice Springs.\\nOwned by junior resources company, Tanami Gold, the Coyote mine has taken 12 years from the discovery of its first gold deposits to actual mining.\\nThe project was put on hold last year when management decided the price hike in steel

plea to anyone who\\'s changing the act is for goodness sake make it clear just precisely what the role of the Wheat Export Authority or its successor body may have,\" he said.\\nSenators at the hearing also attacked WEA chief executive Glen Taylor over his pay package, age and qualifications.\\nLiberal Jeannie Ferris wanted to know why wheat growers paid Mr Taylor $350,000 last year.\\n\"Mr

Peter McGauran for backflipping on a decision to reduce the levy.\\n\"All the grains industry needs to be pushing in the same direction,\" he said.\\n\"Unfortunately the grains council is alienating some of the key stakeholders and having difficulty working with them and I just don\\'t think that\\'s my style and I don\\'t think it is going to give us the best outcome.\\n\"I mean there was a

there is no other incentive to grow the renewable energy industry, because the Federal Government will not increase its targets.\\nEnergy Minister Theo Theophanous says power companies will only buy more green energy if they have targets to meet.\\n\"We are still not quite at 10 per cent renewable for the whole country and that\\'s why we are currently looking at the question of whether Victoria should just develop its own renewable energy type scheme, similar to the national MRETS scheme,\" he said.\\n\\nIndustry welcomes crackdown on illegal fishing\\nThe fishing industry has welcomed new Federal Government legislation cracking down on illegal fishing.\\nFisheries Minister Eric Abetz is planning to introduce legislation today that contains a maximum penalty of three years in jail and

industry is set for a major shakeup, with the Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) to abandon its auction rooms in Sydney and Melbourne and slash the size of its board.\\nAWEX will end its auction room leases at Yennora in Sydney and Brooklyn in Melbourne by the end of the year, handing the ball to wool brokers, who already run sales rooms in Newcastle and Fremantle.\\nA review of company services has found the wool industry holds market reporting and wool classer services above the provision of selling centres, although grower bodies and exporters have been surprised by the decision.\\nChris Kelly from exporter Itochu says rival auctions by Australian Wool Handlers has put AWEX under pressure.\\n\"Look I\\'m quite sure that if AWH didn\\'t do what they did, I think this decision wouldn\\'t have been made,\" he said.\\n\"I think the exporters now would quite rightly question the benefit of AWEX in regard to saleroom issues.\"\\n\\nGrim winter rain outlook for eastern Australia\\nDespite previous forecasts, eastern Australia now looks set to receive below average rainfall this winter.\\nThe latest outlook from the National Climate Centre says most of Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland can expect a drier than average year, while Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory can expect close to average rains.\\nClimatologist Blair Trewin says regions still struggling with drought are the least likely to see big winter rains.\\n\"The outlook for northern New South Wales and southern Queensland is a rather dry one,\" he said.\\n\"In most of that region we are saying the chances of above average rainfall are only 35 to 40 per cent so about a 60 to 65 per cent chance of coming in below normal.\\n\\nAWB to boost payments to growers\\nIn some good news for the wheat industry, AWB Limited has increased the amount of money it will pay growers next year to reflect a big jump in world grain prices.\\nThe National Pool Price is up $15 a tonne, at $220 for the benchmark Australian premium white wheat.\\nThat is $32 higher than the current harvest price.\\nAWB\\'s National Pools manager David Johnson says the move has been fuelled by a poorer crop outlook in the US, and higher investment in the futures market by hedge fund speculators.\\n\"While futures have been rallying the cash market for wheat has not been reflecting that full rally in prices and this is one of the major reasons why we have a number of people saying the pools aren\\'t going up as much as they could have and that is because the cash wheat market internationally has not gone up as much as the futures markets are reflecting,\" he said.\\n\"Stocks continue to tighten, that certainly augurs well for prices as we move forward.\"\\n\\nCole inquiry\\nIn related news, the head of the Australian Federal Police will meet with Oil for Food Commissioner Terence Cole next week, as he weighs up whether to investigate evidence from the inquiry.\\nAFP commissioner Mick Keelty has told a Senate estimates hearing there has been no decision on whether to press charges against AWB employees.\\nUnder questioning he told the hearing evidence from the Cole inquiry is yet to be referred to the federal police.\\n\"Not as yet Senator, I have a meeting with the royal commissioner on the first of June,\" he said.\\n\"I don\\'t suppose he\\'s indicated what meeting\\'s about?\" asked the senator.\\n\"Well I don\\'t think that\\'s an appropriate question to ask the commissioner in any event, even if he knew,\" Mr Keelty said.\\nMeanwhile the Federal Opposition has stepped up attacks on AWB for claiming a tax deduction on its $300 million kickback payments to Iraq.\\nLabor says AWB has legal advice claiming it will not suffer a tax penalty on the deduction, and has called on the Government to step-in.\\nBut Assistant Treasurer Peter Dutton says the matter is in the hands of the Australian Tax Office, and it will decide if AWB should be penalised.\\n\\nPM defends vote on Snowy Hydro sale\\nPrime Minister John Howard has rejected legal opinion that a vote on the sale of the Commonwealth\\'s share in Snowy Hydro is unconstitutional.\\nHe says the Government will press on with the sale, despite admitting most Australians are against it.\\nOpposition to the sale has built considerably since the Government and Labor agreed on a motion seven weeks ago, which cleared the way for the sell-off.\\nThe Greens and some government members say they have legal advice the Parliament should have voted on legislation, and not just passed a parliamentary motion.\\n\"The process of getting parliamentary approval for the sale of commonwealth Snowy Hydro shares is illegal,\" said Greens leader Bob Brown.\\nMr Howard expects to hear more opposition from within his own party to the sale next week, but says his own legal advice is clear.\\n\\nGG foreshadows future outback tours\\nAfter a fortnight sleeping in his swag, the Governor-General has called for all future governors-general to take annual tours of the outback.\\nOver the past two weeks, Major General Michael Jeffrey has covered thousands of kilometres from the Birdsville track to Western Australia\\'s Tanami Desert, trying to bridge the divide between city and country.\\nMajor General Jeffrey hopes an annual event could showcase the positives of rural life.\\n\"And I\\'d hope to persuade my successors to do the same things, so it becomes part and parcel of the Governor-General\\'s role to be out there in the bush, be seen to be in the bush and to be seen to be saying well done folks,\" he said.\\n\\nBeef giant pays $97m for Top End stations\\nAustralia\\'s biggest beef producer will pay $97 million for two

regulation of animal welfare debate\\nThe Australian Veterinary Association says governments must regulate how the animal welfare debate is presented to children.\\nIt is critical of a campaign being run by animal rights group Voiceless, which encourages school children to speak out against issues like live exports and factory farming, saying its biased and threatens farming livelihoods.\\nPresident, Dr Matt Makin says children should be exposed to the debate, but is questioning what he says are extremist views from both sides.\\n\"You know this is also a responsibility for governments who are in charge of school curriculums,\" he said.\\n\"They need to, you know, be ensuring that children are exposed to all the facts on both sides of the debate so that the younger generation can form their own opinion.\\n\"And presenting them with one side of the debate, I think, if this Government doesn\\'t do anything about that I think it\\'s quite irresponsible.\"\\n\\nDNA used to identify stolen sheep\\nPolice have used DNA testing to identify sheep at the centre of stock theft investigations in Victoria.\\nThe Mildura Magistrates Court has found a farmer from Murrayville, in the state\\'s north-west, guilty of theft, after DNA testing proved the genetic line of 40 cross-bred lambs.\\nSenior constable Andrew Harris says while the value of the sheep was at the lower end of the scale, the case demonstrates the value of the technology in investigations.\\n\\nRiverland grape growers seek compo\\nThe Riverland Wine Grape Growers Association wants a partial compensation package from the Federal Government.\\nIt says the assistance drop uncontracted grapes on the ground, avoiding the need for them to sell fruit to wineries at low prices and contribute to the national oversupply.\\nExecutive officer Chris Byrne says the money could come from the Wine Equalisation Tax.\\n\"That would go a long way towards compensating growers not to sell their fruit at 100 or 200 dollars a tonne,\" he said.\\n\\nViolence disrupts aid to E Timorese farmers\\nAustralian aid efforts to help farmers in East Timor are being disrupted by violence which has erupted in the capital, Dili.\\nThe Seeds of Life project introduces and tests new varieties of major food crops for subsistence farmers.\\nTeam leader Rob Williams says roadblocks around Dili are making it hard to get out to surrounding districts.\\n\"The work in the district continues on, we need to build planting material up, ready for next wet season,\" he said.\\n\"Cassava, sweet potato, corn-seed and those plants are still growing on.\\n\"We have staff in the districts who are continuing on with the work. The civil disturbance hasn\\'t affected them, anywhere near as much as it has in Dili. There\\'s drivers delivering sweet potato cuttings, we have staff irrigating maize crops, so that we have enough seed and planting material for next year.\\n\\nGreen award for horticulture industry\\nEfforts by the horticulture industry to stop using one of the worst chemicals to affect the ozone layer have been internationally recognised.\\nThe tomato and strawberry industries have phased out the use of methyl bromide.\\nAustralia agriculture has just been given an ozone protection award from the Environment Protection Authority in the US, which Jeff Mcspedden from Ausveg says recognises our clean and green industry.\\n\"There\\'s been some research done on alternatives and that was to use softer chemicals and the other one was to use steam generators to steam the soil, or to use solarisation where they plough it in the hotter climates and let the sun get rid of nematodes and problems in the soil,\" he said.\\n\\nMerger could have dire consequences for Nationals: analyst\\nAn expert on rural politics says the in-principle merger agreement between the Queensland Liberal and National parties is a disaster for the federal Nationals.\\nThe agreement stems from months of talks between the Queensland conservatives parties on how best to beat Labor Premier Peter Beattie.\\nBut political analyst Professor Brian Costar from Swinburne University says a merger even at a state level would have dire consequences for the Nationals in Queensland and federally.\\nHe says a merger could cut the Nationals representation in the federal ministry and reduce the vote of both parities, leading to the rebirth of a \\'One Nation style\\' party.\\n\"Some of the issues that gave rise to One Nation, and particularly in Queensland where it was strongest, are still bubbling along below the surface,\" he said.\\nFederal party leader Mark Vaile has distanced the Nationals from a federal merger saying there has never been a better time for regional areas to have a specific rural conservative party.\\nIn Queensland, the merger proposal has received a mixed response.\\nJust 18 months ago it was rejected out of hand, but today it is seen as the only way to ultimately topple Labor.\\nLecturer in politics at Brisbane\\'s Griffith University Paul Williams says farmers could be the ultimate losers.\\n\"I think that they potentially have a lot to lose,\" he said.\\n\"One can suspect that over time that the Nationals\\' voice will be drowned out.\\n\\nFarmers\\' confidence at low levels\\nNearly one third of farmers are expecting conditions to worsen in the coming year.\\nWith a third successive survey in which confidence has declined, Rabobank head of rural banking, Neil Dobbin, says it is almost at the lowest level since surveys began.\\nMany farmers in New South Wales and Queensland are anxiously waiting for rain in order to start their winter cropping and livestock producers are also affected by the lack of feed and on-farm water supplies.\\nMr Dobbin says the drought is causing great stress.\\n\"We are really concerned for our clients and for the rural industry as a whole, there is nothing worse than being in this period of time when you are sitting on the fence if you like, waiting for rain,\" he said.\\n\"We are in no man\\'s land and we just pray that we really get some good rains and we need substantial rains.\\n\"We just need that break, get the crops in, there is a lot of hand feeding going on at the moment.\\n\\nMore extreme weather predicted for Victoria\\nVictoria\\'s Department of Primary Industries is predicting the state will experience more extreme weather, with increasing temperatures and less rainfall.\\nIt is carrying out a research project called the Climate Change Challenge to try to help farmers adapt.\\nProject leader David Halliwell says most farmers in drier areas like the Wimmera and Mallee are used to a variable climate, but they might not be ready to cope with what climate models are predicting.\\n\"Our frequency of extreme weather events are likely to increase into the future,\" he said.\\n\"It is also saying that on average temperatures will increase but this doesn\\'t just mean the maximum temperatures will increase, but the minimum temperatures will increase a little bit as well.\\n\\nAQIS officers on alert in NT\\nQuarantine authorities in the Northern Territory are on full alert, as evacuees from East Timor continue to arrive.\\nMore than 700 of the estimated 25,000 people displaced from Dili have flown into Darwin.\\nC-130 Hercules cargo planes are carrying up to 180 evacuees at a time from Dili to Darwin on unscheduled flights.\\nSo far, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has checked over 720 evacuees from East Timor and 209 crew from the Defence Force.\\nWhilst many of the passengers are traumatised and are carrying the bare minimum in the haste to escape the unrest, all bags are being X-rayed or searched for exotic plants like siam and khaki weed, and diseases such as grapevine leaf rust.\\nThe giant African snail is also a major risk, and clothing, and footwear is being searched for its eggs, which can be carried in soil material.\\n\\nWine export prices drop\\nThe latest wine industry survey has found wine export prices are down by a third since 2002 and 40 per cent of Australian wineries are running at a loss.\\nThe Deloitte Wine Industry Benchmarking Survey indicates many wineries are struggling to survive, particularly in export markets.\\nDeliotte partner Stephen Harvey says the big supermarket chains in Europe have taken advantage of the Australian wine glut and are forcing prices down, and the whole industry is feeling the pain.\\n\"We are seeing a lot of it go over for buyers\\' own brands in the big supermarket chains, your Sainburys, Tescos, Aldis etc,\" he said.\\n\"That of course does have a flow-on effect to the branded wines. If people are able to buy buyers\\' own brands at very cheap prices, it naturally adds some pricing pressure to your more popular and well-known brands.\"\\nMeanwhile, grape growers in South Australia\\'s Riverland have welcomed the proposal for a partial compensation package.\\nAbout 600 people attended a rally yesterday, hearing proposals from the local grower association, which will be put to Friday\\'s wine industry summit in Melbourne.\\nThe package recommends growers with uncontracted grapes be paid $5,000 per hectare to not harvest them in the hope of reducing the national oversupply.\\nThe $80 million cost would be shared by governments and industry.\\nLoxton grower Glen Arnold says he hopes the proposal is considered.\\n\"It\\'s a way forward for growers to have some hope,\" he said.\\n\\nCanola price on the way up\\nThe price outlook for canola has improved over the last few weeks, with Canadian carry over stocks and projected plantings being reduced.\\nAs well, Canada has reported improved crush tonnages and canola exports.\\nKatie Cole, from Cooperative Bulk Handling in Albany in Western Australia, says there is also good news on canola pricing from Europe\\'s bio-fuel industry.\\n\"Europe is also the last major reason why we\\'re seeing some really good news in the canola market and that\\'s the bio-diesel industry,\" she said.\\n\"Europe\\'s expected to double it\\'s consumption of vegie oils for bio-diesel this year which will mean going up from 3 million tonnes to 6 million tonnes.\\n\\nStation sale to allow for expansion\\nThe head of Heytesbury says the sale of two of its cattle stations will allow for more strategic investment into its existing live export cattle and wine businesses.\\nHeytesbury announced the $97 million sale of Anthony Lagoon and Eva Downs Stations in the Northern Territory to Australia\\'s biggest beef producer, Australian Agricultural Company, on Friday.\\nChairman Janet Holmes a Court says while there are no immediate plans to purchase other stations, the company might look to consolidate some of its operations.\\n\"It gives us the opportunity also to maybe expand our wine operations or buy other properties that are closer to the VRDs and the Kimberley properties that we already have,\" she said.\\n\\nRaspberry levy to go into marketing\\nRaspberry growers across Australia will have to pay a new industry levy from July 1 to cover costs of more research and development.\\nThe $13 million industry is set to be boosted by the 10 cents a kilo levy, which will be collected by wholesale agents and supermarkets, and imposed on exported berries.\\n\\nTomato growers aim for sweet success\\nGrowing sweeter tomatoes has been identified as the major goal for Australian growers over the next five years.\\nProcessing tomato growers, whose crops are made into paste and sauce, are currently drawing up their Industry strategic plan.\\nOver the last 30 years, the amount of tomatoes produced per hectare has risen from 25 to 84 tonnes.\\nBut the chair of the Australian Processing Tomato Research Council, Ian Bryce, says their taste suffered.\\n\"The sweetness of tomatoes has gone down,\" he said.\\n\\nNFF concerned about Snowy Hydro privatisation\\nOpposition to the privatisation of Snowy Hydro continues to build.\\nThe nation\\'s chief rural lobby group has, for the first time, expressed serious concerns about the sale and its effect on the National Water Initiative.\\nThe National Farmers Federation (NFF) fears little regard will be given to farmers who rely on Snowy Hydro\\'s water if the scheme is sold-off.\\nAnd NFF president Peter Corish says funds from any privatisation should be used to protect the environment, irrigators and affected river communities.\\nHe has also called for tighter regulation of Snowy investors, including a permanent 10 per cent cap on ownership of Snowy shares.\\n\"We want to ensure private ownership of the water behind a dam wall, which is something that is certainly new, it\\'s a new principle for us in Australia that doesn\\'t negatively impact on the people who benefit from that water currently,\" he said.\\nThe three federal independents will table a motion in Parliament today, calling for the sale to be blocked entirely.\\nAnd Nationals MP Kay Hull plans to introduce a private member\\'s bill into Federal Parliament to permanently cap individual shareholdings in Snowy Hydro to 10 per cent.\\nThe legislation would also stipulate that the majority of directors be Australian and that the head office remains in this country.\\nMrs Hull opposes the sale, but says, as a last resort, this bill would limit foreign ownership.\\n\"I will continue to fight the sale, this is a safety net in the event the sale can not be ceased,\" she said.\\n\"I want to ensure that enshrined in legislation is all of the safeguards that need to take place to ensure that big companies and overseas companies can\\'t come in and buy up the Snowy.\"\\nIt is unclear whether the private member\\'s bill will receive the support of the Government or the Opposition.\\n\\nSnowy River clearance work \\'too little, too late\\'\\nA group of farmers in Victoria\\'s Gippsland region says blockages at the mouth of the Snowy River are being overlooked.\\nReduced flows and drought have caused a sandbar to form across the mouth of the Snowy at Marlo, flooding local pastures and crops.\\nClearance work began yesterday but residents say it is too little, too late.\\nParks Victoria ranger Dennis Matthews says opening the mouth of the Snowy is difficult and he sympathises with farmers whose properties have been flooded.\\n\"It\\'s not easy being a farmer enduring drought and so on, and then having something like this happen,\" he said.\\n\"I can understand fully their plight A lot of people farm in low lying areas so I can understand that they would like to see conditions of opening changed.\\nQueensland Nationals leader Lawrence Springborg is pushing ahead with his plans to merge his party with the Liberals despite significant opposition from both federal Coalition party leaders.\\nThe Prime Minister says he will only support the Nationals becoming Liberals, while federal Nationals leader Mark Vaile is worried his party will be destabilised by the discussions.\\nThis morning in Canberra, National and Liberal politicians were locked in a joint party room meeting discussing the proposal but Mr Springborg says he does not need their approval.\\n\"Queensland could still go it alone and there\\'s a whole range of ways that you can do this to accommodate the concerns that have been raised because those matters have not had the chance to be able to be put,\" he said.\\n\\nBeef industry helps out in quake recovery effort\\nThe Australian beef industry is helping with the recovery in quake-hit Yogyakarta in Java.\\nFeedlotters, including the Consolidated Pastoral Company\\'s Indonesian Joint Venture, are among those helping fund aid for 100,000 homeless people.\\nNurendro Trikesowo of the Indonesian Cattle and Buffalo Farmers Association says he is installing 20 health clinics and 20 simple water filters this week.\\n\"That is just a pocket filter system, using some ceramic filters, to make the purification of the water, filtering the water from [toxic bacteria such as] E. coli,\" he said.\\n\"That is an important thing, that the water will be hygienic to drink for the people. [But] we are just a small part because they need a lot of funds for the recovery and reconstruction.\\n\\nGoat meat processor seeks more overseas workers\\nThe meat processing industry is negotiating with the Immigration Department about the use of overseas workers.\\nThe nation\\'s largest goat meat processor, Neil Duncan of Charleville in Queensland, says he needs more overseas workers if he is to stay in operation.\\nBut Mr Duncan says the department has stopped processing applications for skilled workers under the 457 visa program.\\n\"The Immigration Department needs to recognise that the meat industry does need skilled workers,\" he said.\\n\"We can source skilled workers from overseas. They are there waiting and unless they actually start processing our applications, the meat industry in Australia is going backwards.\\n\"We\\'ve got to the stage now where we\\'re turning away livestock. We can\\'t process livestock because we just don\\'t have the people to be able to do it.\"\\n\\nGrain boosts ABB profits\\nSouth Australian agriculture company ABB grain has announced a 24 per cent rise in after tax, half-year profit.\\nThe result for the two-year old corporation is largely attributed to a 35 per cent increase in grain receivals for the last season.\\nGrain market analyst, Malcolm Bartholemaeus, says that despite the malting section of the company struggling, it is still a strong result.\\n\\nWheat consortium expected to announce Iraq deal\\nAn Australian consortium negotiating a 350,000 tonne wheat contract with Iraq is expected to announce this afternoon it has sealed a deal worth close to $100 million.\\nLast Monday, Wheat Australia said it had failed to come to suitable terms with Iraq and negotiations for the $90 million dollar deal were over.\\n\\nStrawberry prices tipped to fall\\nStrawberry prices could fall dramatically later this year.\\nQueensland\\'s strawberry season is under way, with growers enjoying the best prices they have seen in over a decade - up to $8 a punnet in some supermarkets.\\nBut Bill Sharpe, from the Queensland Strawberry Growers Association, says there will be an oversupply and rock-bottom prices by September.\\n\"Somewhere along the line the middle man get certainly the benefit of it with this oversupply, but the blame is sort of twofold anyway,\" he said.\\n\\nWA bans biodiesel plants\\nWestern Australia\\'s Agriculture Protection Board has placed a state-wide ban on two plants being heavily promoted on the Internet as sources of biodiesel.\\nBellyache bush and physic nut are both invasive plants, highly toxic to humans and livestock.\\nBoth plants are already on the WA declared plants list, but their status has been upgraded to make sure they are banned state-wide.\\n\\nHundreds of stock horses to gather for Polocrosse World Cup\\nUp to 200 Australian stock horses will be drafted for next year\\'s Polocrosse World Cup in Queensland.\\nThe event will see eight international teams play over a 10-day period in April, at Warwick on the Darling Downs.\\nWorld Cup chief horse coordinator, Kent Wells, said it is the nation\\'s biggest recruitment of horses in peacetime.\\n\"Every state will have some,\" he said.\\n\\nYoung Aussies urged to see outback\\nFrom the tracks of Birdsville to the Tanami Desert, the administrator of the Northern Territory has called for an outback visit to become a rite of passage for young Australians, similar to the Gallipoli pilgrimages on Anzac Day.\\nTed Egan has proposed a heritage tour, which would particularly encourage city kids to head to the bush.\\nHe says it would help show important elements of this country\\'s history,\\n\\nExtension granted for forestry tax change submissions\\nAn extension of time has been granted for submissions on the changes to plantation forestry taxes.\\nSome of the changes include putting a cap on expenditure on plantations in the first year and tax write-offs being conditional on best practice being used.\\nThe closing date for submissions has been extended for another month, until mid-July.\\nAssistant Treasurer Peter Dutton says it is in response to requests for more time from a number of affected farmers and foresters.\\nBut he denies there has been a backlash to the proposed changes.\\n\"Right around the country in rural areas some farmers are strongly in favour of the way in which these forestry plantations are operated,\" he said.\\n\"Other farmers outside of the industry have concerns that there is the potential for high prices, inflated prices to be paid for land.\\n\\nMixed predictions for pulp mill\\nShareholders of Tasmanian forestry giant, Gunns Limited, have been advised that the company\\'s plans to build a pulp mill are risky and they should sell their shares.\\nThe Commonwealth Bank\\'s shares and stockbroking arm, CommSec, predicts Gunns\\' planned $1.4 billion pulp mill will never be cost-effective.\\nBut industry analyst, Robert Eastment, says he has checked the facts in the report, and does not believe the negativity is warranted.\\n\"It\\'s just another report. There are some good ones, there are some bad ones,\" he said.\\n\\nGrain consortium hopeful of more deals with Iraq\\nAustralian grain consortium Wheat Australia says it does not envisage any shipping problems when it begins the export of 350,000 tonnes of wheat to Iraq in the next month.\\nTwelve weeks of negotiations concluded yesterday when Wheat Australia announced the $100 million wheat contract with Iraq had been finalised.\\nSpokesman Rhys Ainsworth says with one agreement reached, Wheat Australia is keen to explore further market opportunities.\\n\"I think the good thing about the position that Wheat Australia has got to now is that we have agreed on commercially workable terms that we believe can provide Wheat Australia with a solid platform that will enable it to continue what has been a very long association with one of Australia\\'s most critical international markets,\" he said.\\nPlum Grove commodity trader Tony Smith says the deal is good news for Australian growers but prices are still below what farmers in the United States would receive.\\nHe estimates the deal to be worth around $190 a tonne, about $30 below expectations, but does not believe AWB could have done much better.\\n\"At the end of the day, this deal would not have gone ahead if the AWB wasn\\'t happy with the price,\" he said.\\n\"So there\\'s no way the AWB could\\'ve got more. You know, Wheat Australia did everything they could. There\\'s definitely people who are going to come out and make those comments and they\\'re just political comments, scaremongering.\\n\\nPlanned merger not achievable, Vaile says\\nFederal Nationals leader Mark Vaile says a proposal to merge the Queensland National and Liberal Parties now won\\'t go ahead.\\nHe met with Queensland Nationals leader Lawrence Springborg yesterday and while he denies he has convinced Mr Springborg to abort the plan, Mr Vaile thinks the merger is not achievable.\\nHe says effort now needs to go into developing the Queensland Coalition.\\n\"Clearly if you look at the public comment and concern that\\'s been raised we are fast reaching a point where that is not going to be achievable,\" he said.\\n\"So my view we need to ensure that Queensland moves ahead developing and refining the existing Coalition arrangements in Queensland.\"\\nDeputy federal leader of the Nationals Warren Truss says there is strong support for a united conservative force in Queensland but the merger model was unfair and unworkable for members of the National party .\\n\\nSnowy Hydro foreign ownership cap not enough: rice growers\\nThe Ricegrowers Association of Australia says the cap on foreign ownership of Snowy Hydro is not enough to protect irrigators\\' interests.\\nThe New South Wales, Victorian and Federal Governments yesterday agreed to permanently limit foreign ownership of the scheme to 35 per cent, with a cap of 15 per cent for individual foreign investors.\\nBut Ricegrowers Association president Laurie Arthur says that would not prevent a large Australian company buying a majority stake.\\n\"It\\'s some recognition that the governments are listening to the concern that have been put to them,\" he said.\\n\"It doesn\\'t go far enough, we still believe there\\'s the capacity for an Australian company to have undue influence as regards to the licence that control the water and the release of water.\"\\nThe Murray Darling Basin Commission and the National Farmers Federation are also worried about aspects of the deal.\\nBut federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says regardless of who owns Snowy Hydro, the interests of irrigators are guaranteed in the Snowy water licensing agreement.\\n\"It was developed by the Australian, New South Wales and Victorian Governments at the time of corporatisation specifically to protect security, it guarantees the volumes for irrigators,\" he said.\\n\\nMcGuigan Simeon writes down wine stocks\\nWine company McGuigan Simeon will write down wine stocks by up to $20 million and will not pay a final dividend to its shareholders this year.\\nOn Monday the company asked the Australian Stock Exchange to halt its trading until this morning, when the results of an operational review were released.\\nManaging director Dane Hudson says the company was forced to write down stocks because of the recent decline in bulk wine prices.\\n\"It\\'s a small percentage of our total stock,\" he said.\\n\"This is probably a 9 per cent reduction and it\\'s for older vintages. We are comfortable with our 2006 vintage but this is older stock that we need to reprice to clear on the bulk market.\"\\n\\nSurvey points to excellent outlook for dairy farmers\\nThere is an excellent outlook for Australia\\'s dairy industry.\\nDairy Australia has released its latest report based on the annual dairy farmer survey and interviews with industry members.\\nThe report finds nearly two thirds of dairy farmers are looking to increase the scale of their operations but many smaller operators are selling out or changing to beef or crops.\\nIncreased demand means strong price competition for suppliers between processors.\\nBut one of the report\\'s authors, Steve Spencer, says processors are concerned that tight supply will mean a loss of markets.\\n\\nNaracoorte meatworkers angry over wages\\nLocal workers at a South Australian abattoir are angry that their hours have been cut, while Chinese employees on temporary visas are being paid full-time wages.\\nTwo hundred and sixty Australian workers at the Teys Brothers meatworks at Naracoorte have been working a four-day week because of a shortage of stock.\\nBut even though the Chinese workers are working a similar number of hours, their visa conditions require that they receive a full week\\'s pay.\\nGraham Smith, from the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union, says it is absurd.\\n\"The meat industry is seasonal to start with,\" he said.\\n\"Where the terms of the visa are that you\\'ve got to have a severe skills shortage that you\\'ve got to fill, it seems absurd that in an industry where we stand people down for large parts of the year because there\\'s no work for them, that you can say there\\'s a corresponding skills shortage.\"\\n\\nFarmers give Vic Budget thumbs down\\nThe Victorian Farmers Federation says the Victorian Budget has failed to target pressing road, rail and water infrastructure needs in rural areas.\\nIn fact, the farming body says the State Budget is so disappointing that it may campaign against the Bracks Government during the November election.\\nVFF president Simon Ramsay says while funding for education is welcome, the Budget is one of missed opportunities.\\n\"The roads is the main one,\" he said.\\n\\nLettuce aphids found in SA\\nThe currant lettuce aphid has been found in South Australia for the first time.\\nAuthorities have detected the pest on properties in the Adelaide Hills and the northern Adelaide Plains.\\nThe aphid was found in Victoria last year and has plagued lettuce crops in Tasmania since 2004.\\nOriginally, South Australia banned imports of interstate lettuce to protect the industry, but this has now been removed.\\n\\nTas apple industry facing challenges\\nThe future of apple growing in the Apple Isle is being re-examined, in the light of increased global competition, a high dollar and increasing production costs.\\nFruit Growers Tasmania has held a growers meeting to discuss the challenges.\\nOne of the more well-known orcharding families, the Drieesen brothers at Castle Forbes Bay, is opting out of the industry after 50 years.\\nJos Driessen says the land, overlooking the scenic D\\'Entrecasteaux Channel, will be sold to sea changers.\\n\"My plans for the future are to retire.

Coalition voters in regional Australia.\\nLabor leader Kim Beazley met with the National Farmers Federation (NFF) last night.\\nHe says he wants to open a new dialogue directly with regional Australia.\\nMr Beazley says Labor and farmers have plenty in common, despite Labor\\'s opposition to the Workchoices policy and importing foreign workers, which are both supported by the NFF.\\nMr Beazley says the party will win seats in regional Australia at the next election based on what he says is a cumulative affect of issues like the sell-off of Telstra, Australia\\'s trade performance and the now defunct Nationals merger.\\n\"After a while everyone wakes up and this is what\\'s happening now,\" he said.\\nMr Beazley says regional development spokesman Simon Crean and disendorsed Opposition agriculture spokesman Gavan O\\'Connor will lead the regional policy push.\\n\\nBeef exporters brace for US competition\\nThe United States is hoping to cut Australia\\'s $500 million beef market to South Korea when exports resume next week.\\nMeat and Livestock Australia\\'s regional manager in Korea Glenn Feist says exporters are bracing themselves for major competition for the first time in more than two years.\\nHe expects to see export levels drop but hopes Australia will be able to hold onto a market share of around 50 per cent.\\n\"Australia won brand of the year twice in a row here with the country of origin labelling with our statement: \\'Australian beef clean and safe\\',\" he said.\\n\"But since the US has been out it has given us an opportunity and we grow beef for the five star dining hotels and that sort of stuff - we have got manufacturing beef for the McDonald\\'s and the Burger King [chains] and those guys.\\n\"So I think we will hold our own pretty well up here.\"\\nThe Cattle Council says Australian producers are likely to retain their stronghold on the market for bone-in beef in Korea.\\nThe amount of US beef allowed in will be limited by a continuing ban on cattle over 30 months of age, which will help Australia remain competitive, according to council president Bill Bray.\\n\"The main trade in beef into Korea has been the bone-in short rib and we\\'ve been asked to continue to supply that because we have the highest freedom-ranking for BSE in the world,\" he said.\\n\\nIrrigation charge increase expected to hurt farmers\\nMany New South

only involved four buyers.\\nHe says the company only wants to sell 10 per cent of Tasmanian wool through the pool system but admits that figure could increase.\\n\\nSimplot increases prices for pea growers\\nVegetable processor Simplot says it is responding to the concerns raised through the Fair Dinkum Food Campaign by offering Tasmanian farmers better prices and contracts for their

Coodardie Brahman Stud supplies weaner steers to Taminmin High School on Darwin\\'s outskirts.\\nThe bush steers are broken to halter and presented for show and sale by the students.\\nStud director Moira O\\'brien says it helps to give them a better understanding about the production and marketing cycle of the cattle industry.\\n\"We really enjoy helping them out and working in their program, and I think it\\'s really important for that industry community, collaboration, and anywhere where we can encourage young people and teach city people about agricultural life and cattle station workings and the industry, I think is really, really important,\" she said.\\n\\nIrrigators pass no confidence vote in NSW Govt\\nA vote of no confidence has been passed in the New South Wales Government over its handling of the sale of Snowy Hydro.\\nThe move by Riverina irrigators comes as Finance Minister John Della Bosca meets with concerned farmers today at Deniliquin in the state\\'s south.\\nLast night in Deniliquin, 300 people showed their displeasure at the New South Wales Government\\'s handling of the sale of Snowy Hydro.\\nMr Della Bosca was invited to the public meeting, organised by the Nationals but declined.\\nToday, in the same town, he will talk with irrigators in a closed meeting to hear their concerns about the sale of Snowy Hydro.\\nOrganised by the Southern Riverina Irrigators Group, farmers say they are worried about what will happen to water entitlements if the Snowy scheme is privatised.\\n\\nIrrigators relieved at Snowy Hydro sale collapse\\nIrrigators say they are surprised and relieved at the collapse of the sale of the Snowy Hydro electricity scheme.\\nThe Federal Government pulled out of the sale this morning, citing concern from backbenchers and growing public opposition.\\nThe New South Wales and Victorian Governments have also backed down.\\nLaurie Arthur from the Rice Growers Association says he did not think there was any way to stop the sale.\\nHe says irrigators were worried about their access to water once the scheme was privatised and most will be pleased with the about-turn.\\n\"I\\'m sure probably 80 per cent of irrigators are delighted that Snowy Hydro will not be privatised,\" he said.\\n\"I think some of our people think that governments don\\'t do a particularly good job of running companies and so it\\'s still a very complicated issue and I would predict that we haven\\'t actually seen the last of it within the next 10 years would be surprised if it doesn\\'t raise its head again.\"\\nPrime Minister John Howard says although irrigator licensing conditions were a factor in the Government\\'s decision, it was public opinion that forced the change.\\n\\nGovt urged to protect local ethanol industry\\nThe ethanol industry says it will be devastated by a Federal Government proposal to allow cheap imports into Australia.\\nLegislation table in Parliament calls for the excise on imported ethanol to be reduced by 2011 to the same rate as locally-produced biofuel.\\nIt also outlines a planned increase in taxes for Australian-made ethanol from 2.5 cents a litre to 12.5 cents.\\nBob Gordon from Renewable Fuels Australia says the Government should do more to protect the local industry.\\n\"Unlike other countries we are going to be one of the first countries in the world to actually tax renewable fuels,\" he said.\\n\"Now we\\'re prepared to live with that but we want a regime for transition that stimulates new industry growth rather than undermining it.\\n\"The one proposed in the tax Bill will clearly undermine that goal.\"\\nResources Minister Ian Macfarlane has denied the claims.\\nHe says ethanol will still have an excise advantage over petrol and the industry has had years to prepare for the changes.\\nMeanwhile the Federal Government has decided to phase in its changes to the diesel fuel rebate, to give farmers and transport operators time to adjust.\\nThe plan will replace cash payments to farmers with a refund added to GST rebates and was due to be implemented on July 1.\\nBut now, during a two-year transition period, farmers will be able to claim their rebate, but will also have to report it in business activity statements.\\nSouth Australian farmer Doug Hall says that will make the system more complicated.\\n\"I just don\\'t see it being any easier at all, it just doesn\\'t make sense to me so why are they playing around with this you know, who is the winner at the end of the day?\" he said.\\n\"I\\'m certainly not sure it\\'s the farmer, it\\'s the damn Government again.\"\\nThe renewable energy industry wants a national incentive-based market to encourage consumers to use cleaner fuel.\\nIt has released a report looking at development to 2050, in which renewable energy will be cheaper, have high export potential and provides a clean and cheap solution to climate change and energy shortages.\\nDavid Holland from Renewable Energy Generators Australia says the Federal Government should extend tax breaks to get the technology up and running.\\n\"The technologies will always be more expensive than the old process of pulling coal out of the ground and setting fire to it,\" he said.\\n\"The environment is a critical issue not just for Australia but for the planet and really the governments are the only people that are in the position to take that leadership but there needs to be some systemic processes that drive the move towards renewables.\"\\nThe Government has rejected the call, saying hundreds of millions of dollars have already been allocated to renewable energy generation.\\n\\nCode of practice limits use of sow stalls\\nThe pork industry has agreed to limit the use of sow stalls under a new code of practice for the welfare of pigs.\\nAustralian Pork Limited, the peak body representing producers, says it will reduce the amount of time pigs spend in the stalls, from the full 16 weeks of pregnancy to six weeks.\\nPeter Robertson from the New South Wales Farmers Association says it is a proactive step to improve animal care.\\n\"The industry has taken the decision that we have to concede that we need to have sows with a little more exercise during gestation,\" he said.\\n\"By the same token we need the sow stalls for the first six weeks that they are pregnant so that they do not abort and have other problems at that stage.\"\\n\\nHunter Valley coal miners remain on strike\\nOne hundred Hunter Valley coal miners are into the second day of a week-long strike after a breakdown in talks over wages and conditions.\\nWorkers at the Xstrata-owned United Colliery are the first to undertake a court-approved stoppage under the new federal industrial relations reforms.\\nThey have been attempting to settle on a new enterprise agreement since December.\\nXstrata says it has made a good offer and believes the strike is part of a broad political campaign by the unions.\\nBut Grahame Kelly from the CFMEU says the offer does not reflect the performance of the work force.\\n\\nBoral Timber mills to close\\nBoral Timber is closing two mills on the north coast of New South Wales as part of a major restructure.\\nThe Kempsey and Bostobrick Mill near Dorrigo will close, with the loss of 47 jobs.\\n\\nGrain growers told to stop sowing crops\\nWestern Australian grain growers are being told to stop sowing crops because there is no rain in sight for at least two weeks.\\nMany farmers have already planted a good percentage of their crops and state authorities say they need to assess their financial position.\\nPeter Metcalf from the Department of Agriculture in Geraldton says it is time to pull up the seeders and start making a plan for the rest of this season.\\n\"What tends to happen in this situation, which is a very unusual situation, most growers haven\\'t previously been in this state, or these conditions previously, is that you start the program and you continue on,\" he said.\\n\\nViolence hits E Timorese agriculture\\nEast Timor\\'s agriculture sector has been seriously affected by recent violence.\\nFires, looting and mayhem in the capital Dili have destroyed eight years of research and documentation.\\nThe price of fresh fruit and vegetables has also sky-rocketed.\\nMinister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Estanislau Da Silva, also fears coffee exports could be down by more than half.\\n\"Now we are in the coffee season. It\\'s the harvesting coffee season and this can have a tremendous impact on the livelihood and the people who depend on coffee,\" he said.\\n\\nUgly sheep could save wool industry\\nThe search is on for the ugliest merino lambs, because they could save Australia\\'s billion dollar wool industry.\\nScientists from the South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI) and the University of Adelaide are looking for sheep with \\'unusual wool\\', saying they hold the key to improving the genetic quality of merino wool.\\nProfessor Phil Hynd from the University of Adelaide says lambs are usually culled because they have uneven wool, no crimp or bare patches.\\nHe says studying the lambs will help them identify genes which affect wool production.\\n\"We\\'ve already got about half a dozen animals that producers provided us with and man, they\\'re the weirdest looking mob of sheep that you\\'ve ever seen in your life,\" he said.\\n\"They\\'re quite embarrassing really, even the sheep look embarrassed.\\n\\nIndonesian fishermen to face court over alleged poaching\\nTwelve Indonesian fishermen will face court in Broome today, accused of poaching the sea cucumber delicacy, trepang.\\n\\nWine grower suggests pulling out cool climate vines\\nA respected South Australian vigneron has suggested pulling out grape vines in cool climate vineyards and putting the land to other use.\\nCoonawarra vigneron Ian Hollick says grape growers in cooler areas have been selling fruit at below the cost of production for the past three years, and there is no end in sight.\\nHe does not think a proposal to compensate struggling grape growers is the way forward for the industry.\\n\"I think its getting to the stage where we have to really bite the bullet and say that we need to remove so many thousands of hectares of cool climate grapes,\" he said.\\n\\nFarmers still want access to Snowy Hydro documents\\nFarmers still want access to confidential information about water releases from Snowy Hydro, despite the collapse of plans to sell the electricity scheme.\\nLast week the New South Wales Government promised to let a delegation of farmers see documents relating to when water is released for irrigation.\\nWithin 24 hours the Federal Government had withdrawn from the sale and it was abandoned.\\nChairman of Southern Riverina Irrigators Ted Hatty says farmers will hold the State Government to its promise.\\n\\nDoctors urge govt reform on rural medical services\\nDoctors say access to obstetric services in rural Australia is becoming critical and are calling for urgent government reform.\\nIn allegations to be aired on ABC\\'s Four Corners program tonight, doctors also claim that in some areas chemotherapy is being administered by people without formal qualifications.\\nThey have also raised concerns about the loneliness of cancer patients forced to move to the city for treatment and the pressures that are forcing doctors to pack up and leave country towns.\\nDr Ross Maxwell from the Rural Doctors Association says the problems are acute and most efforts to solve them are not making much difference.\\n\"We have been reluctant to try and look at the economics around rural and remote practice and say well if the mining industry want to get professionals out into a remote community they make sure the conditions are right and attractive and can get them out there,\" he said.\\n\\nGroup seeks Govt help to reduce regional alcohol abuse\\nA national alcohol rehabilitation group is calling on the Federal Government to help stem the rise of alcohol abuse in regional Australia.\\nThe Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation wants the Government to fund ongoing campaigns in rural areas because the level of injury and death from alcohol are much higher than in the cities.\\nFoundation chief executive Daryl Smeaton says it does not make sense that $2 billion has been spent on campaigns against illicit drugs, when only 5 per cent of the population use them.\\nHe says for 85 per cent of people, alcohol is their drug of choice.\\n\"We think of a drug problem, we think of cannabis and amphetamines because that\\'s what the Federal Government keeps on telling us,\" he said.\\n\\nTas cow tests positive for hydatid tapeworm\\nA Tasmanian bred cow has tested positive for the hydatid tapeworm, the state\\'s first case in a decade.\\nTasmania embarked on a world leading hydatid eradication program 40 years ago and while hydatids have been discovered since, most have been traced to imported stock.\\nThe state was declared provisionally-free of hydatid disease in 1996.\\nChief vet Rod Andrewartha says the infected cow was part of a mixed line of cattle.\\n\"Occasionally of course we will detect cysts and we can normally trace them back to sheep or cattle imported from the mainland, in this particular case we found it in an animal which was born and bred in Tasmania,\" he said.\\n\\nHerpes-like virus threatens Vic abalone stocks\\nEfforts are under way to control a herpes-like virus which is killing abalone off the south-west Victorian coast.\\nThe disease, ganglioneuritis, has been detected at four farms in south-west Victoria and at Flinders near Port Phillip Bay, with millions of dollars worth of stock having to be destroyed.\\nFisheries Victoria says the disease has now escaped into the wild off Port Fairy.\\nFisheries executive director Peter Appleford says although a similar disease devastated the abalone industry in Taiwan in 2003, he is hopeful control measures will stop a further spread here.\\n\"What we\\'re looking at is to put some controls in place along the coastline to limit the activity there,\" he said.\\n\\nDept, fishermen warn of imported prawn disease\\nQueensland\\'s Department of Primary Industries has issued a warning against using imported raw prawns as bait, amid growing concerns they could carry disease.\\nCommercial fishermen want raw prawn imports stopped, claiming health inspections are too random.\\nThey say up to 60 consignments have recently tested positive for white spot disease, the so-called foot and mouth of prawns.\\nDr Ian Anderson, Queensland\\'s principal veterinary pathologist on fish disease, agrees that imports do pose a threat.\\n\"Prawns imported for human consumption can get purchased by recreational fishers and then used in their fishing activities and so that is a potential route of the spread of the virus from the imported product for human consumption through to our wild fishery stock,\" Dr Anderson said.\\n\\nLobster fishermen deny flooding market with snapper\\nSouth Australian lobster fishermen have rejected claims they are flooding the market with snapper and forcing down prices.\\nThe SA Rock Lobster Advisory Council says fishermen are entitled to fish for snapper in the lobster off-season but have only caught 10 tonnes of the fish since July last year.\\nSpokesman Daryl Spencer has denied claims that two lobster boats unloaded 10 tonnes of snapper each at Port Lincoln at the weekend.\\n\"There\\'s one boat at this point in time since the end of our lobster season that\\'s actually targeted snapper and in the 10 days that he has been fishing, he\\'s taken in total 3.9 tonnes in total,\" he said.\\n\\nIndonesian fishermen jailed for poaching sea cucumbers\\nEleven Indonesian fishermen have been jailed after being caught poaching the sea cucumber, trepang, in Australian waters north of Broome in Western Australia last month.\\nThey were on board two boats

urges rural, urban water trading\\nA major scientific report says city water authorities should be allowed to buy water from farmers to sustain the growing urban population.\\nThe CSIRO says without reform, water costs in metropolitan areas could rise more than 10 times over the next 25 years.\\nThe report from the CSIRO and Monash University predicts Perth, Brisbane and Sydney will be the worst affected cities with the price of water jumping up to 10 times unless better reforms are put in place.\\nThree models have been tested and CSIRO says the most successful would be a combination of urban and rural water trading, alongside more efficient water use including desalination plants.\\nAnd while farmers could make a lot of money from water trading, the system would change the face of agriculture in Australia.\\nThe CSIRO\\'s Mike Young says urban/rural water trading is already working in South Australia and WA farmers are leading the way in saving water.\\n\"Agriculture\\'s a lot more skilful in improving water use efficiency and in 25 years time they\\'ve made a 50 per cent greater advance than urban Australia, so there\\'s a challenge for urban Australia to catch up and show they\\'re actually as smart as our farmers are,\" Mr Young said.\\nBit some irrigators are worried about the social impact of water being diverted into the capital cities.\\nAlthough he believes some form of water trading with the cities is inevitable, Victorian dairy farmer Max Fehring says governments need to make sure urban residents share the cost of water infrastructure with rural communities.\\n\\nAust wheat price surges on back of international season\\nThere is finally some good news for grain growers today, with international competition driving a big surge in wheat prices for the 2006-07 season.\\nAWB has released its first price estimates for wheat delivered to the national pool next harvest, with the benchmark Australian Premium White Wheat sitting at $222 a tonne, up $30 on last season.\\nNational Pool manager David Johnson says while prices can still change, Australia is in a good position to capitalise on lower world production figures.\\n\"We have a much stronger fundamental story around hard wheats in particular at the moment, with the US hard red winter crop experiencing some production difficulties,\" he said.\\n\\nExpensive feed grain prices impact on graziers\\nGraziers buying grain to feed livestock this winter are feeling the pinch, with prices continuing to rise.\\nDry conditions, higher petrol prices and strong global grain prices are all affecting the cost of feed grain.\\nRon Storey from Australian Crop Forecasters says the success of grain-fed beef exports is also putting more demand on supply.\\n\"Our demand here for grain domestically is being underpinned very, very solidly by a very strong feedlot cattle market, with grain-fed beef being in strong demand where BSE has given Australia pretty much by most of the market,\" he said.\\n\\nAust Farm Institute urges drought policy reform\\nThe latest conclusions on drought policy reform, prepared for the Australian Farm Institute, say farmers should be encouraged to be better prepared for drought and governments need a major overhaul of how financial assistance is provided.\\nSeveral experts have prepared papers for the Institute and most agree that current drought policy is too focused on crisis management.\\nFinancial adviser Rob Brown argues the policies penalise farmers who run their business in ways to cope with drought.\\n\"If you have prepared, in fact if you\\'ve done the things that are the objectives of the drought policy, then you won\\'t be eligible,\" he said.\\nAnd while there is a belief that government policy can actually worsen the wellbeing of farmers and waste resources, others say that fewer farmers are asking for help because of better farm management.\\nLinda Botterill from the University of NSW believes an income based loan scheme would be simpler and more effective at helping farmers through drought, and be less of a knee-jerk reaction from government.\\n\\nSuspected illegal fishermen head to Broome for questioning\\nSix Indonesian fishermen suspected of poaching the sea cucumber trepang, have been taken to Broome for questioning by Australian Customs.\\nThe Navy intercepted the fishermen at the weekend on a boat near Scotts Reef, 250 kilometres off the north-west coast of Western Australia.\\nCustoms spokesman Peter Costantino claims they were caught with the sea cucumber on board.\\n\"There was a small quantity of trepang found on board the vessel when the Navy boarded it and the fishermen were actively fishing at that time and diving on the reef,\" he said.\\n\"The vessel started to be towed into Broome, but unfortunately broke up. The six fishermen were transported to the HMAS Larrakia and the vessel was destroyed at sea.\"\\n\\nWild rivers legislation will hamper development: groups\\nGraziers and Indigenous leaders on the Cape York Peninsula say future development of the region will be stifled by the Queensland Government\\'s new wild rivers legislation.\\nThe draft policy aims to protect 19 of the state\\'s pristine river catchments, by introducing restrictions on agriculture, aquaculture and grazing.\\nHead of the Cape York Institute, Noel Pearson, says pastoralists and traditional landowners need to work together to fight the policy and environmentalists.\\n\"We find ourselves in a position where the Greens no longer respect the fact people need economic development and the cattle industry in this region, and they\\'ve been winning,\" Mr Pearson said.\\n\\nGroote Eylandt given Indigenous protection status\\nAustralia\\'s third largest island is being declared an Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) today.\\nStakeholders have gathered to celebrate on Groote Eylandt in Northern Territory waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria.\\nUnder the agreement, the traditional owners of Groote Eylandt who speak Anindilyakwa will manage their land for conservation and heritage values.\\nLand Council Chairman Tony Wurramarrba says a local manganese mine is part of the plan.\\n\"Virtually means that we can look after our land, more efficiently.

held in Melbourne on Friday, industry groups were looking for partial compensation from the Government to help growers mothball or hibernate their vines.\\nBut Mark McKenzie from Winegrape Growers Australia says the proposals were not even put on the table, and it is a disappointing result.\\n\"The Minister made it clear that it\\'s an industry issue the industry needs to sort itself out,\" he said.\\n\"Outside the framework of what\\'s currently available there wasn\\'t anything special put on the table other than additional funding to scope the nature of the issue to provide more information to growers to allow them to make those commercial decisions for themselves going forward.\"\\nIn the west, many grape contracts are coming to an end, and John Griffiths from the WA Wine Industry Association says the situation is fragile.\\nWhile warm climate growing areas have already been hit hard, with fruit left on the vine, the oversupply problem is expected to hit cooler areas

Jarvis was awarded for her service to education, the dairying industry, women in agriculture and the community of the Kiewa Valley.\\nShe says the Federal Government has a moral obligation to put more money into tertiary education.\\n\"I think that we\\'ve forced our rural children away from universities in the last 10 years,\" she said.\\n\"The cost to attend university is enormous. I dont\\' believe that brains necessarily only belong to city people. I think there is a great deal of intellectual brain drain from country areas because people can\\'t afford to avail themselves of tertiary level education.\"\\nBroken Hill Identity, \"Brushman of the Bush\" and well known former ABC TV outback adventurer Jack Absalom received an Order of Australia for services to painting and charitable works.\\nWinemakers are also feature prominently, with honours going to South Australia\\'s Brian Barry and the Hunter Valley\\'s Bruce Tyrrell, who believes the industry will turn around.\\n\"Oh yeah it\\'s amazing you know, you go from being the darling to the devil,\" he said.\\n\"The Australian wine industry is copping a heap of bad press at the moment, but behind that is still this phenomenol growth.\\n\\nDesert race comes to an end\\nAustralia\\'s most challenging off-road race is coming to an end at Alice Springs.\\nHundreds of competitors in the Finke Desert Race have pitched their buggies, cars and motorbikes at 450 kilometres of some of the toughest terrain in the country.\\nIt is windy, freezing cold and extremely dusty at the 31st Finke Desert Race.\\nOnly a third of competitors usually complete the track, which is full of bulldust, desert oak trees to dodge and about 70 kilometres of woops which is like driving over thousands of volkswagons in a row.\\nAlready the winners in the buggies have made it home, first place went to father/son team Shannon and Ian Wrench from Warrnambool, Victoria.\\n\\nPloughmen dig in at championships\\nTwenty of Australia\\'s best ploughmen battled for first place at the weekend\\'s National Ploughing Championships in Tasmania.\\nPitting their technical precision against the clock, farmers also had to work in dense fog while competing at Cressy, in the state\\'s north.\\nTwo Victorians were the winners, Adrian Tilling for conventional ploughing, and David Smith for reversible ploughing, and both will represent Australia at the world titles next year.\\nRhonda Smith from the World Plough Organisation says success all depends on the day.\\n\"Ploughmen can plough good on one day and draw a good plot and then some ploughmen can plough under pressure,\" she said.\\n\\nCane smut found on Qld property\\nAuthorities have confirmed the discovery of the exotic disease sugar cane smut at a farm near Childers, in south-east Queensland.\\nAt the start of another cane crush, it is a massive blow to the sector, which has been enjoying good prices.\\nThe infected property has been quarantined and wider surveillance is underway.\\nProperty owner Joe Russo, who is also the chairman of the Isis District Canegrowers, says it has been a horrible time.\\n\"Not only myself, but the whole family, are quite devastated to hear the news,\" he said.\\n\"There\\'s no doubt we\\'ve all understood the disasterous effects smut can bring, but to have it recorded not only in your district, then to have it on your own property, is of a concern.\"\\nThe entire cane crop on the east coast will be inspected for the disease.\\nQueensland has been one of only a few commercial growing regions in the world without cane smut, which can cause major production losses.\\nEoin Wallis from research group BSES Limited says the situation is extremely serious, even though only one infected plant has been found.\\n\"At the moment, because we haven\\'t found anymore plants, we are not able to say whether this is a widespread infestation or simply quite local,\" he said.\\n\\nWater shortage threatens lettuce supplies\\nProduction of Australian lettuces could drop by up to 60 per cent by Septelettuce shortagember because of a lack of water in storages outside Melbourne.\\nSouthern Rural Water has cut water allocations to the Bacchus Marsh and Werribee irrigation districts to between zero and 5 per cent, leaving growers without water, or using recycled waste water.\\nOne of Victoria\\'s biggest coloured lettuce growers, Frank Ruffo, says the both domestic and export supplies will be hit.\\n\"We use all our water for growing lettuce, salads,\" he said.\\nWe supply on a national basis around Australia and we also supply overseas so that is going to ruin our export markets, especially when we\\'ve managed to take them off the American suppliers.\\n\\nResults on mad cow disease research may take years\\nScientists say it could take years to work out whether there is a new strain of mad cow disease or whether the original virus has mutated.\\nUS researchers have confirmed that two cases of BSE in Texas and Alabama during the past year are a new variety of the disease, which is similar to others in Europe and Japan.\\nProfessor Colin Masters from Melbourne University says it is frustrating for agricultural industries which have to wait for the research before finding out whether they can stop any further spread of the disease.\\n\"So far they\\'re very rare and they\\'ve only been found because of this massively increased surveillance,\" he said.\\n\\nWheat growers call for continued government assistance\\nWith a new farm bill on the horizon in the United States, wheat growers there have joined calls for continued government assistance.\\nThe wheat industry is concerned it has a shaky future, after figures showed wheat\\'s portion of the national crop has fallen 10 per cent since the 1980s.\\nGrower organisations say the wheat industry is at a crossroads with little growth in exports, lower domestic consumption and loss of acres to other crops.\\nAs well, there are concerns that wheat diseases are affecting farmers\\' profits and there is little research being done on new wheat varieties.\\nBut while the the industry is keen to encourage new research, it has emphasised it must make economic sense for farmers to want to plant wheat in the first place.\\nAccording to the US department of agriculture, the wheat sector is facing long term challenges to its profitability, but asking for increased subsidies from government is not the answer.\\nThe USDA says subsidies only artificially increase demand, rather than provide long term solutions.\\nThe industry plans to hold a wheat summit later this year to try to work out how it can stay profitable and competitive in the international market.\\nThe Indian Government has called for tenders to supply 2.2 million tonnes of wheat, after a lack of interest in a 3 million tonne deal last month.\\nOnly 800,000 tonnes was allocated from the original wheat tender, with two thirds expected to be filled by AWB.\\n\\nLivestock producers warned over feeding requirements\\nThe Western Australian Department of Agriculture is warning livestock producers to either reduce sheep numbers or pay closer attention to feeding requirements.\\nThere is a severe lack of feed due to dry weather and stock deaths have been reported because sheep are not getting enough roughage.\\nVeterinary officer Marnie Thomas says producers are feeding their sheep lupins as an alternative feed source but they need greater diversity to maintain condition.\\n\"If you\\'ve got stock that you can quit, I would definitely be quitting them now because if this dry keeps going, you\\'re going to be looking at supplementary feeding for anywhere up to six weeks from the break of the season, right up to eight weeks, depending on what sort of pasture you\\'ve got,\" she said.\\n\\nStudy looks at heat stress concerns for helmet wearers\\nMeat and Livestock Australia (MLA) is studying how heat stress might affect station workers forced to wear helmets while riding horses.\\nGraziers across northern Australia have raised concerns that compulsory helmet wearing for employees could increase body temperature and lead to heat stress and fatigue.\\nWith some stations forcing the introduction of helmets as a safety measure, MLA\\'s Wayne Hall hopes the research will lead to better helmet designs.\\n\\nCool dry season could mean early Top End mangoes\\nCooler than average weather this dry season in the Northern Territory could bring forward the mango harvest.\\nNight time temperatures across the Darwin rural area have been more than three degrees cooler than average this month.\\nFlowering is under way across mango orchards of the Top End and extension officer Greg Owens says fruit could mature by mid September.\\n\"The trees were pretty much set up for it from a very small harvest season last year,\" he said.\\n\"They had good reserves from the tree and having that cold snap follow on from that rain seems to have triggered a lot of trees that were ready to go off.\\n\\nFarmers call for more help to for biodiesel production\\nFarmers trying to establish commercially viable biodiesel operations say the Federal Government needs to do more to encourage development.\\nVictorian farmer Josh Pearse, who has set up a plant at Donald, in the state\\'s west, says taxing biodiesel at the same level as ordinary diesel is a disincentive to farmers making or using it.\\nHe says in the face of rising fuel costs, grain farmers particularly, have a great opportunity to start growing some of the fuel they need for their farms.\\n\"There should be a few more incentives for people to actually get into the biodiesel industry, and even for some sort of tax benefit for farmers and for people to start using biodiesel,\" he said.\\n\\nDemand soars for softwood\\nAustralian softwood producers say they are experiencing their highest levels of demand for years, with more shipments of pine woodchips and steadily rising prices.\\nGrowing demand from the Japanese paper industry is driving the export market growth, as the Japanese economy picks up and the consumption of paper and paper products increases.\\nPhil Lloyd, from South Australian processor Auspine, says the last 12 months have seen demand exceeding supply.\\n\\nWA finds nifty solution to cane toad menace\\nA specially trained sniffer dog has been chosen to hunt down cane toads at the border between Western Australia and the Northern Territory.\\nNifty, a two-year old female belgian malinois, will begin training immediately and start work in Kununurra from September.\\nGaye Mckay from WA\\'s Department of Conservation and Land Management says Nifty is part of an overall plan to keep cane toads out.\\n\"Anything that can stop cane toads from entering WA is a worthwhile investment,\" she said.\\n\\nRural workers at risk of cancer, report shows\\nA new report has found workers in rural industries like agriculture, forestry and mining are most at risk of developing cancer.\\nThe study by the Queensland Cancer Fund and the University of Sydney has found twice as many people as previously thought are exposed to cancer-causing substances at work, including pesticides, UV rays and dust.\\nGordon Gregory from the National Rural Health Alliance, says country workers face a double whammy, because a lack of medical care in the bush can severely reduce the chance of survival.\\n\"Agriculture forestry and fishing are dangerous occupations - but normally we tend to think in terms of accidents,\" he said.\\n\"Now we have got this report which frankly surprises me that it is also the cause of high rates of cancers.\\n\\nSnowy Hydro rethinks development plans\\nSnowy Hydro says it will be forced to borrow heavily, now that its planned privatisation has been scrapped but staff jobs are safe.\\nThe Federal Government scuttled plans to sell the power generator earlier this month.\\nManaging director Terry Charlton says the sale would have given Snowy Hydro access to extra funds but the company now must rethink its development plans.\\n\"We\\'re looking at increasing our borrowings, cutting back on capital expenditure, cutting back on other expenditures, hopefully being able to defer some expenditure on the scheme and substitute it with other growth opportunities,\" he said.\\n\\nFarmsafe maintains cancer risks minimised\\nA farm safety group has defended the sector\\'s use and management of pesticides after a new report said people in agriculture were among the most at risk of developing cancer.\\nThe study by the Queensland Cancer Fund and the University of Sydney found twice as many people as previously thought faced cancer-causing substances at work, including pesticides, UV rays and dust.\\nBut Jamie Cupples from Queensland-based Farmsafe says risks have been greatly minimised because primary producers must go through chemical accreditation programs.\\n\"We haven\\'t had the evidence that there\\'s a huge rate of cancer in the rural industry being caused by pesticides,\" he said.\\n\\nMore sugar cane smut cases under investigation\\nQueensland authorities are investigating possible new cases of the fungal disease sugar cane smut.\\nThe disease, never before found in eastern Australia, has the potential to reduce cane yields by up to 30 per cent.\\nIt was confirmed on a farm near Childers yesterday and further cases are now suspected in another block on the same property.\\nChris Adriaansen, from Queensland\\'s Department of Primary Industries, will not say how many plants are affected, but denies smut is here to stay.\\n\"No, no, absolutely not. It may be that we will find sequentially a number of small infestations over a period of you know it could be 12 months or even possibly longer,\" he said.\\n\\nWool campaign targets US market\\nA test marketing campaign for wool has been launched to try to tap into the billion dollar clothing market in the United States.\\nSaks of Fifth Avenue and retailer Dillards have been signed to try to educate the US consumer about the benefits of wool by marketing woollen trousers.\\nThe Woolmark company says there is a huge market to be gained from the $6 million investment.\\nBut consultant Graham Lean says the push in the US is misguided and the best way to increase grower returns is to cut costs.\\n\\nGold price fall puzzling\\nResource analysts are puzzled why the price of gold suffered a meltdown in New York trade overnight.\\nThe price of gold dropped $US44.50 an ounce, its biggest single day drop since 1991.\\nHartley\\'s resource analyst Andrew Rowell cannot explain the decline in gold and copper prices.\\n\"We\\'re not actually really sure as to why it\\'s such a big drop. It came off last night in New York, it started at the start of the day and kept going,\" he said.\\n\"I guess we\\'re at a bit of a loss to see exactly the reasons why it was so pronounced.\"\\nIn other commodity news, Australia\\'s export earnings from mineral resources fell $1 billion to $21 billion for the March quarter.\\n\\nQueenslander wins NFF top job\\nQueenslander David Crombie is the new president of the National Farmers Federation (NFF).\\nMr Crombie is the former chairman of Meat and Livestock Australia and former chairman of the Queensland Reds.\\nMr Crombie takes over from outgoing president, cotton grower Peter Corish.\\nVictorian dairy farmer Allan Burgess was the other candidate for the peak farming group\\'s top job.\\nThe announcement was made in Canberra, where farmers from all over Australia and representatives of a wide range of agricultural industries are meeting, to draw up their strategies and priorities for the coming 12 months.\\nDelegates from around Australia will today be debating the NFF\\'s stand on telecommunications and native vegetation.\\nThe telecommunications debate is timely given the NFF\\'s initial support for the Telstra plan to maintain a presence in rural Australia.\\n\\nCold snap takes toll on prawn operator\\nThe cold weather snap in the far north of Western Australia has taken its toll on one aquaculture venture.\\nSix hundred and sixty thousand prawn fingerlings are feared dead after the spate of cold weather, including overnight lows of eight degrees.\\nThe marine prawns stop feeding at 20 degrees and die at 13 degrees, and owner Ian Crimp says there is not much movement in the tank.\\n\"The water monitor shows the temperature is down to 14.5 at the present time and it\\'s getting pretty low and will be probably devastating for the prawns,\" he said.\\n\"These little ones might be in the great prawn house in the sky by now. Prawn heaven!\"\\nThe rising cost of fuel is also threatening the seasonal harvest of banana prawns.\\nSome trawlers caught up to 10 tonnes more when authorities extended the season by a fortnight.\\nBut fisherman Ean Casey says the good catches were not enough to cover fuel, competition from cheaper imported prawns, and labour shortages.\\n\"It\\'s been was a worse year than previous years even though we caught more,\" he said.\\n\"This year we found it very hard to get people. We will probably look at bringing in overseas labour (from Indonesia).\\n\\nSummer fruit industry looks for Govt support\\nThere are calls for Federal Government support for the summer fruit industry following signals the Taiwanese export market will not reopen in time for next year\\'s harvest.\\nExports were suspended late last year because of Taiwanese concerns over a Queensland fruit fly.\\nSummerfruit Australia\\'s Wayne Boucher fears if exports to Taiwan resume, an extra 10,000 tonnes of stone fruit could flood the domestic market.\\n\"We\\'d have to say that it is looking highly unlikely that the work that is currently being done will be completed in time for us to get access to the Taiwanese market in time for this season,\" he said.\\n\\nNew concerns over NSW land clearing laws\\nLandholders across New South Wales are being warned the Native Vegetation Act will have a far greater impact than was originally thought.\\nThe Act stops broadscale land clearing across the State.\\nGabrielle Holmes\\'s family has been prosecuted twice under the Act, without conviction, for the removal of native invasive scrub.\\n\\nPricey pup fetches new record\\nWhat price would you pay for a good working dog?\\nWell you can expect to dig even deeper after a Victorian bred kelpie fetched $5,400 over the weekend.\\nTasmanian farmer Neil Monks bought the 20-month-old pup sight unseen, and had no qualms at forking out an Australian record amount for the dog, Bagalla Mick.\\n\"The way I look at it there\\'s no limit on the value of a good dog,\" he said.\\n\\nWeather takes its toll on farmers\\nDrought is worsening across south-eastern Australia.\\nIn the New South Wales Murray Valley region, 650 irrigators are now eligible for exceptional circumstance assistance until next January.\\nIn Victoria\\'s north-east, several farmers are shooting sheep, or selling stock below market prices.\\nDirector of Hume Corridor Community Health, Wayne Weaire, is organising community barbeques in the region to support farmers:\\n\"In the last drought we found that people if they became isolated from each other, if they simply worked hard on farm or simply sat around wondering what they could do there were enormous amounts of stress,\" he said.\\n\"It just has an impact on the whole sense of well being on the family or the individual and we found last time the greatest lesson was how important it is to get out there and talk and get access to information and support from each other and from other agencies.\"\\nAnd cold weather is a problem too.\\nCitrus growers in the Murray Valley and the Riverland are keeping an eye out for frost damage.\\nIndustry experts claim that damage occurs if the temperature drops below -2 overnight for longer than four hours and that has already happened several times this winter.\\nSome growers fear a repeat of 1982 when young trees died because of the extreme weather.\\nHorticulturalist Steven Falivene says growers need to keep in contact with their citrus packer if they believe their fruit has been damaged by frost.\\n\"The real damage happens at say two weeks afterwards,\" he said.\\n\\n\\'Ultra virgin\\' olive oil technique patented\\nA Tasmanian olive grower has patented a new oil processing technique to produce what he calls \"ultra virgin\" olive oil.\\nBrian Hinson says olives grown in Tasmania\\'s cold climate produce higher than world standard levels of oleic acid, giving an even healthier oil that should attract a premium.\\nHe says the secret to the high oil levels is harvesting early and taking no more than 12 hours from picking to processing.\\n\\nIncoming farm leader wants united voice for agriculture\\nBuilding a united voice for agriculture and raising the community\\'s awareness of farming are just two of the aims for newly elected National Farmers Federation president, David Crombie.\\nMr Crombie, a businessman and former chairman of Meat and Livestock Australia, says the NFF\\'s role is to push the farming agenda with government, and emphasise the importance of agriculture to the economy.\\nHe says targeting falling memberships amongst farm organisations is also critical.\\n\"We can\\'t afford division, we can\\'t afford confusing messages coming out of agriculture,\" he said.\\n\"Look, I\\'d like to see all farm organisations members of NFF, but once again you have to create a valued proposition for those people, if a producer feels that there\\'s no value in being a member of an organisation then he won\\'t join, quite simply. I think the challenge for farm organisations and for NFF is to create that value proposition.\"\\nOutgoing President Peter Corish says the NFF\\'s biggest challenge is to deal with the weak financial position of the organisation\\'s farm body members.\\n\\nRe-structure talks on the cards for peak seafood group\\nThe future of the nation\\'s peak seafood lobby group is uncertain, after directors placed the Australian Seafood Industry Council into voluntary receivership.\\nA funding shortfall from voluntary levies and a lack of communication is being blamed for its demise.\\nTerritory representative Rob Fish says the industry is expected to meet within four weeks to discuss re-structuring.\\n\"I am not aware of many industry associations that can work on voluntary contributions,\" he said.\\n\"Most are levied across the industry, providing with constant budgets, so you can budget across. Without that, I can\\'t see it working myself.\\n\\nALP figures back compulsory ethanol levels in fuel\\nThe push to mandate ethanol levels in petrol has a new ally - the ALP, with key Labor figures in New South Wales and Queensland said to be pushing for a 10 per cent biofuel component in fuels.\\nA motion to that effect was unanimously passed at the NSW Labor conference last weekend..\\nThe Labor move comes as the federal National Party leadership heads in the opposite direction, ruling out any compulsory standards being adopted despite a good deal of backbench and National Party support for biofuels.\\nThe Government doesn\\'t support mandating of alternative fuel because we believe that would have a very likely if not certain market distortionary effect,\" said Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran.\\nBut NSW Labor MP for Bathurst, Gerard Martin, thinks the move to mandate ethanol levels in fuel is a \"no brainer\".\\nHe says pressure is being brought to bear on Kim Beazley and the Federal Opposition to get behind a cleaner, cheaper renewable fuel.\\n\\nDrought tightens grip in NSW\\nNew drought figures have been released for New South Wales, painting a dire picture this winter.\\nAfter the lowest May rainfall in 50 years, 89 per cent of the state is now officially drought declared, up from 62 per cent the previous month.\\n\\nExtending local content rules won\\'t allay Nationals\\' fears\\nThe chairman of the Federal Government\\'s policy committee on communications says the National party\\'s concerns about cross-media ownership plans would not be allayed by an offer to extend local content rules to regional radio.\\nCommunications Minister Helen Coonan told the National Press Club she is considering forcing regional commercial stations to air a set amount of local production.\\nNationals MP Paul Neville, who chaired an inquiry into regional radio, says his party will continue to push for more concessions on the controversial media changes.\\n\\nSmut-infected cane to be destroyed\\nMore sugar cane smut has been found on a south-eastern Queensland cane farm.\\nAuthorities have confirmed that up to three hectares of smut-infected cane has been found on the already quarantined property near Childers.\\nWith the industry biosecurity plan in full swing, decisions on how to destroy affected cane and whether local sugar mills will be allowed to crush have yet to be made.\\nJoe Russo, who discovered the disease on his family farm last week, says it is a hot spot of infection and crops will have to be destroyed.\\n\\nFormer wool industry leader backs marketing campaign\\nA test marketing campaign for wool in the United States is money well spent, according to a former industry leader.\\nFormer senior executive of Wool International Bob Richardson has defended the joint venture with Saks of Fifth Avenue and retailer Dillards.\\nHe says the initial investment of just $6 million will be recouped by growers several times.\\nMr Richardson rejects the assertion made by consultant Graham Lean that money spent on promotion has no impact on wool prices.\\n\"Absolutely I do. It is just so simplistic to think that just because there is not that correlation that therefore promotion of wool has not been successful in the past,\" he said.\\n\\nLack of rain blamed for reduction in grain export licences\\nThe lack of winter rain in Western Australia has forced the state\\'s Grain Licensing Authority (GLA) to reduce the number of special export licences it issues this season.\\nThe GLA is responsible for granting special export licences for WA barley, lupins and canola, and has approved just four out of nine licences in the latest round of applications.\\nChairman Wayne Obst says with the seeding window fast diminishing, seasonal conditions are too risky to hand out further licences at this stage.\\n\"We looked at nine applications and five were deferred because of the season, some for canola and some for malt barley, because we feel at this stage it would be not appropriate to look at it, when the situation for canola is less than ordinary,\" he said.\\n\\nNZ farmers encouraged to head to Tassie\\nRepresentatives of a Tasmanian council are in New Zealand at the moment trying to entice farmers to relocate from the land of the big white cloud to the Apple Isle.\\nThe Circular Head Council is distributing a booklet at this week\\'s New Zealand National Agricultural Field Days, giving a regional and economic profile of the northern Tasmanian region.\\nThe council\\'s strategic projects officer, Lisa Nelson, says compared to New Zealand, prime dairy land in Tasmania is almost half the price and any farmers who make the move will have no problem settling in.\\n\"Tasmania\\'s very similar to New Zealand in a lot of respects,\" she said.\\n\\nShorthorn bull sells for record Aust price\\nA new record has been set at the National Shorthorn Show in Dubbo in New South Wales, with a shorthorn bull selling for $75,000.\\nThe bull was exhibited by the Calrossy and Cowper Schools at Tamworth, and bought by John Nitschke from Hahndorf in South Australia.\\nAuctioneer Mike Wilson thinks Nero 62K Zee Top, as he is called, may have even gone one better than setting a record Australian shorthorn price.\\n\"I think it\\'s a world record, I know there was a bull in Canada called Signature who made about $US37,000 and I think $75,000 yesterday is a world record price,\" he said.\\n\\nPhantom cattle prompt audit of livestock ID system\\nThe Federal Government has ordered an independent audit of Australia\\'s national livestock identification system.\\nThe system allows Meat and Livestock Australia to electronically trace cattle from birth to slaughter using ear and rumen tags, but it has been controversial since its inception 12 months ago.\\nThe Agriculture Minister, Peter McGauran, says he has ordered the audit after criticism from the Australian Beef Association (ABA), which claims there are 11 million \\'phantom\\' cattle on the database that do not exist.\\nBut the minister has warned the ABA against tarnishing the beef industry\\'s reputation.\\n\"Such criticism can potentially harm the industry,\" he said.\\n\\nReport at odds with Govt over options for Murray\\nA draft report by the Productivity Commission, designed to canvass options to re-invigorate the Murray River has found that engineering projects are unlikely to save enough water.\\nThe study finds the best solution is for governments to buy back water for environmental flows.\\nBut Federal Agriculture Minister, Peter McGauran, rejects the idea of governments buying water through licences, allocations or options.\\nBernie Wonder, from the Productivity Commission, says science and engineering are not enough to address the shortfall in the Murray River of some 500 gigalitres.\\n\"We do need to go a bit further in terms of finding the quantity of water that has been identified and if we look only to those infrastructure solutions and that is going to be a very expensive way to go,\" he said.\\n\\nAWB execs quit\\nTwo more executives have resigned from wheat exporter AWB.\\nBoth men were closely connected to the company\\'s oil for food dealings with Iraq.\\nMichael Long, currently head of international sales, was in charge of the Middle East desk at the wheat exporter during the oil for food program, and has given evidence to the Cole Inquiry about trading arrangements at that time.\\nAWB was embarrassed when photos of Mr Long and former chairman Trevor Flugge, appeared in the media showing the men carrying guns on a tour of Iraq.\\nCharles Stott, currently in charge of Landmark, also appeared at the inquiry and repeatedly denied any knowledge of kickback payments.\\n\\nBudget not supportive of processors, says farmers association\\nTasmanian farmers say last night\\'s state Budget does not do enough to support processors.\\nAlthough it describes the Budget as farmer friendly, the Farmers and Graziers Association says processors need relief from payroll and land taxes.\\nAssociation executive officer Greg Bradfield says processors of dairy, meat and vegetables are farmers\\' first-end customers and deserve more support.\\n\"It\\'s very important that they\\'re competitive because they\\'re under a lot of competitive pressure from interstate and overseas so we want to make sure that the whole value chain is competitive so that farmers can get the most out of that value chain as possible,\" he said.\\n\\nMinister plays down prospect of banana imports\\nBanana growers and the Federal Agriculture Minister have rejected media reports that Australians will be eating imported bananas within months.\\nWhile there have been calls for imports, because of the high price of bananas after Cyclone Larry destroyed the Queensland crop, the Government is standing by local growers.\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says an import risk asssessment is currently underway, but previous assessments have ruled out imports.\\n\"We will not be in any way susceptible to the temptation to bring in bananas as a short-term risk,\" he said.\\n\"We know the damage that that could cause to our industry, which would be even more devastating than Cyclone Larry\\'s effects.\"\\n\\nCowra meatworks dispute settled\\nAn industrial dispute at a meatworks in New South Wales, which gained national attention, has been settled.\\nThe Cowra abattoir dismissed a number of employees, offering their jobs back at a much lower pay rates, under the new industrial relations laws.\\nUnder political pressure, the company reinstated the employees under their previous award, while pay negotiations took place.\\nState Meatworkers Union secretary, Charlie Donzow, says while some workers will receive less money, the pay is much higher than the dismissed workers had been offered.\\n\"The area where they won\\'t gain as much is when the company goes into levels of production over and above the minimum they put in place now,\" he said.\\n\\nMore smut found in Qld cane\\nYet more sugarcane smut has been found in south-east Queensland, forcing the Isis Mill to postpone the start of its crush.\\nThe mill was due to start operating on Monday but yesterday, authorities told a growers\\' meeting that delaying the crush would give surveillance teams a better chance to determine how widespread the smut problem is.\\n\\nMulesing alternatives available from 2007: AWI\\nTwo alternatives to mulesing will be available for farmers by 2007 and 2008 respectively, beating the 2010 deadline set between wool growers and animal rights group PETA.\\nWool Research body Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) had its trials set back earlier this year when the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service rejected a key product, collagenase as a biosecurity threat.\\nBut head of blowfly control at AWI, Jules Dorrian, says a new product, producing similar results, has received the all clear.\\n\\nRetrenched Beaconsfield gold miners urged to head west\\nRetrenched miners from Tasmania\\'s Beaconsfield gold mine are being lured to Western Australia with the promise of good jobs and a secure lifestyle.\\nFifty-two workers were made redundant after the April rock fall that killed one miner and trapped two others.\\nWestern Australian Mines Minister John Bowler says his government has set up a special migration service to assist miners wanting to relocate to the booming resources state.\\n\"We\\'ve got heaps of jobs over here, wonderful lifestyle, great to raise your families,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re just saying to those workers at Beaconsfield if you haven\\'t got a job and you\\'ve got a young family and you want to start anew, Western Australia is a great place to be.\\n\\nCrop growers desperate for rain\\nThe need for rain across north-west Victoria\\'s grainbelt is now desperate.\\nA run of severe frosts this week has depleted moisture levels further.\\nDepartment of Primary Industries agronomist Rob Sonogan says about 80 per cent of the Mallee\\'s crops are sown and most have germinated.\\nBut he says without rain since the May break, many have failed to develop secondary root systems.\\n\"I\\'ve actually sighted a couple of situations, very small areas in paddocks where the crops have actually died,\" he said.\\n\\nSnow causes problems for NZ farmers\\nThis week\\'s storms on New Zealand\\'s South Island, which have dumped more than 60 centimetres of snow, have caused management problems for farmers.\\nHelicopters are delivering emergency supplies to those in more remote communities, including fodder for farm animals.\\nPresident of the Mid-Canterbury Federated Farmers Rupert Curd says power is out on the Canterbury Plains and electric fences on dairy farms are on the blink.\\n\\nGM cotton row heats up\\nDebate over genetically-modified (GM) cotton in northern Australia is heating up, with two biotechnology companies applying to the Commonwealth regulator for licences.\\nThe Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) rejected a similar proposal four years ago, which means GM cotton cannot be grown commercially in the Australian tropics.\\nEnvironmental groups say any new GM cotton could become established as a tropical weed.\\nBut Ord River farmer Rob Boshammer says it is unfair that the north is missing out on the new technology.\\n\"I think it is a very dangerous situation where parts of the country can be allowed to use technology and other parts not,\" he said.\\n\"It seems totally unfair to me if you live one side of the 26th parallel you can grow GM cotton, if you live a metre the other side of the 26th parallel you can\\'t.

Prices are reasonable. There is always going to be shelf space there as the bananas are quite expensive and they would be stocking very, very few bananas,\" he said.\\n\"But I think also there is a preference to citrus as well.

Kidman and Co produces beef for markets in Japan, the US and South-East Asia on properties on the Georgina and Diamantina Rivers and Cooper Creek.\\nChief executive Greg Campbell says a moderate flood earlier this year was not enough to stop destocking.\\n\"Throughout the Channel Country at the moment we\\'re about 50 to 60 per cent stocked,\" he said.\\n\\nRain brings relief to WA farmers\\nThere has finally been some rain relief in Western Australia, with falls along the western coast overnight.\\nOnly marginal falls were recorded inland, with some grain growers faring better than others.\\n\"By 6:00pm last night I\\'d had 20.2 millimetres and then overnight another 7.5mls, so for those few hours it was 27.7 and it\\'s absolutely fantastic,\" John Williams from Bindoon said.\\n\"Just so great to see all this rain after all this time. Those that have been waiting for the rain will be able to put their crops in and those that have dry sown, this will help them along just great.\"\\nGarth Cowald from West Canna says he had 4.5 millimetres of rain last night.\\n\"We haven\\'t sown any wheat yet, getting a bit late now, the ground is too dry. We haven\\'t had hardly any rain now for three months. We have sown lupins and oats but it hasn\\'t come up,\" Mr Cowald said.\\n\"So with the costs now days, I think it\\'s better to leave the seed and fertiliser in the shed and the chemicals and just take it from there.\"\\n\\nLow demand reduces NT pig market\\nContract pig shooters in the Northern Territory are selling off their hunting dogs because they do not have an export market this year.\\nMore than 20 registered shooters around the town of Katherine cull hundreds of feral pigs during the dry season and ship the meat to Germany.\\nBut this year demand and prices are so low, not a single pig will be going overseas.\\nHunter Athol Schmidt says it is bad news for the environment, because without an export market it is too expensive to hunt.\\n\"At the moment the stuff that\\'s coming out of Queensland and northern NSW is just filling the pet food market,\" Mr Schmidt said.\\n\"The prices down south they opened up at 60 cents per kilo, they tell me they\\'ve gone to 80 but you\\'re still flogging a dead horse.\\n\\nCommissioner to investigate bushfire practices\\nConcerns about bushfire prevention and recovery measures in Victoria will be investigated by the state\\'s emergency services commissioner.\\nCommissioner Bruce Esplin has been meeting with farmers and other groups, who believe not enough fuel reduction burns were done before the Grampians bushfires in January.\\nMr Esplin says the report will assess what progress has been made since his report on the 2003 Alpine fires.\\n\"I made a lot of recommendations in that report, 148 recommendations in fact, and I think it\\'s time that we put out a report to the community about what\\'s happened, what\\'s the progress on each of those recommendations, \" Mr Esplin said.\\n\\nTimbercorp branches out to compete with NZ imports\\nAgribusiness company Timbercorp is diversifying into the tomato business, in a bid to compete with imports.\\nIt is to spend $25 million building Australia\\'s biggest truss tomato glasshouse at Two Wells, north of Adelaide.\\nChief executive Robert Hance says it will produce 5,000 tonnes of tomatoes for the domestic market, the same amount that is imported from New Zealand each year.\\n\\nQld farmers highlighting green thumbs\\nQueensland grain growers are introducing a set of environmental guidelines to show off their \\'green\\' credentials.\\nLobby group Agforce is collating a best management practice manual in the Fitzroy Basin, in central Queensland, with plans to roll it out across the nation.\\nSpokesman Kym Bremner says they want to prove to the Government and urban Australians that they are being pro-active and addressing problems.\\n\"The uptake of zero till, while it\\'s been fairly spectacular, is still something that people need to work on,\" Mr Bremner said\\n\\nEgg industry seeks to boost sales\\nThe egg industry has launched a push to get more people eating eggs, after figures show Australia has the lowest rate of consumption of eggs in the western world.\\nOn average we eat 169 eggs each per year, a long way below the Japanese, who eat 350, or the Americans, who consume 260 eggs each.\\nJames Kellaway from the Australian Egg Corporation also says that while Australians are offered a wider choice of eggs, most are buying cage industry products.\\n\"Just over 80 per cent of Australia\\'s production is represented in caged eggs and that has a price point attached to it which is relatively lower than that price point attached to barn-laid or free-range eggs,\" Mr Kellaway said.\\n\\nLongest-running land claim now over\\nThe longest-running land claim in the nation is being resolved today in the Gulf of Carpenteria, 700 kilometres south-east of Darwin.\\nJust over 21,000 hectares across the Sir Edward Pellew Islands, is being officially handed back to the Yanyuwa people, after 30 years of debate.\\nMany of the original claimants are not alive to see their dream come true, but 71-year-old Steve Johnson says the hand back provides an incentive for others to move back onto traditional lands.\\n\"It\\'s good to see that we are getting our island handed back after so long. There has been a number of deaths in the Yanyuwa and [other] clan groups, 130 all up in that time,\" Mr Johnson said.\\n\"[But] I think it will make them feel a lot better, that they can move around more freely in their own country.\\n\"The only thing that would be a factor now is the cost of fuel, petrol, diesel stuff like that to get out there.\\n\\nGrain Council agenda baffles ex-president\\nFormer Grains Council president Keith Perrett says the peak body is losing the confidence of growers and creating divisions in the industry.\\nYesterday the council slammed a new survey calling for changes to the single desk for wheat exports, saying Single Vision Grains Australia had no authority to conduct it.\\nMr Perrett headed the Grains Council between 2001 and 2005, but claims it is now failing to provide leadership.\\nHe says he is baffled by its current agenda, which seems to be politically-driven.\\n\"Certainly most growers that I speak to say \\'what\\'s going on here at the moment\\',\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s a bit beyond me as to why they would be taking that line, you know the easy answer is to say \\'well it\\'s a bit of patch protection\\', I\\'m not sure what the outcomes are why they\\'ve come down the path they are.\\n\"Certainly I\\'d be taking a different approach to the one that\\'s being taken at the moment.\"\\n\\nCorporation\\'s decision may cost timber industry jobs\\nThe timber industry says up to 2,000 jobs are under threat from the Australian Rail Track Corporation\\'s decision to use concrete rather than timber sleepers to upgrade the Melbourne to Brisbane rail line.\\nThe National Association of Forest Industries says saw mill operators were expecting to supply up to 400,000 timber sleepers a year for the next five years.\\nBut the association\\'s Catherine Murphy says they have now been told timber is no longer required.\\n\"It\\'s not just along the Murray there but it\\'s the north coast of New South Wales and I understand sleepers are also produced in Queensland and Western Australia,\" she said.\\n\"This is a specific market that many of these saw millers have invested $10 million, for example, over the past two years in upgrading their mills specifically to provide timber.\"\\n\\nFarming practices blamed for looming mice plague\\nNo-till farming practices and left over seed from last harvest are being blamed for a looming mice plague on South Australia\\'s upper Eyre Peninsula.\\nSurveys have shown more than 4,000 mice per hectare, the highest number since 1995.\\nUnlike conventional seeding, sowing crops with the no-till method leaves one distinct furrow for mice to follow and burrow into to eat grain.\\nBuckleboo farmer Jim Hamlin says the mice are just another problem when they are already facing a cold, dry start to the season.\\n\"Where some of the crops are up, they\\'re chewing off leaves and in other places, where the crops are not up, they\\'ve dug under the ground and got the grain as well,\" he said.\\n\\nBusinesses suffer as dry conditions continue\\nDry conditions on pastoral properties south-east of Alice Springs have taken their toll on businesses which service the area.\\nIt has been four years since the region has had any decent rain and stock feed is scarce.\\nRodney Mingel, who runs Mingel\\'s Heli Service, has grounded one of three helicopters this season and stood down a pilot.\\nHe says mustering work has been halved, due to the lack of rain and lower stock numbers.\\n\"From now on through to September is really our busy period,\" he said.\\n\"There\\'s just not much happening, I mean people have done their work, work that they normally do towards the end of the year they\\'ve done at the beginning of the year.\\n\"Cattle numbers are down, so there\\'s not six paddocks to muster anymore there\\'s one.\\n\\nMurray River levels drop\\nThere is concern about the state of the Murray River this winter.\\nRiver Murray Water says its storages are only 40 per cent full and has reduced river flows to protect current levels.\\nWith a lack of rain across the catchment as well, parts of the river between Mildura and Swan Hill are only waist deep.\\nColignan citrus grower and river boat enthusiast Robert Mansell says the river is as low as he has seen it at this time of year.\\n\"It\\'s really, really interesting,\" he said.\\n\\nRain enables farmers to finish sowing crops\\nWelcome rain over the grain belt in Western Australia this week has many farmers back out in the paddock to finish sowing crops.\\nThe Western Australian Farmers Federation has surveyed its members and president Trevor De Landgrafft says that for many, the season is a long way behind, after one of the driest May and June periods on record.\\n\"Forty per cent of the respondents have less than half of their crop in the ground,\" he said.\\n\"Half of those people don\\'t have any crop in at all.\\n\"Sixty per cent of respondents have got more than half their crop in and two thirds of that number somewhere between 80 and one 100 per cent.\\n\"We\\'re saying we think about half the crop that has been sown is out of the ground.\"\\n\\nSoft international demand blamed for drop in milk prices\\nAustralia\\'s largest milk processor has lowered the prices it will offer dairy farmers this year.\\nThe move by Murray Goulburn to drop prices by 2.9 per cent follows a 5 per cent cut announced by New Zealand-based Fonterra.\\nThe company\\'s Ian MacAulay is blaming softer international demand.\\n\\nGreen light given to abalone farm\\nThe first land-based abalone farm in New South Wales has been approved on the state\\'s mid-north coast.\\nNative abalone is under threat from poaching and aquaculture is seen as a way of preserving numbers.\\nBut local conservation groups fear the development could pollute coastal waters and destroy seagrass beds.\\nGraham Housefield from Australian Bounty Seafoods says he has done everything he can to deal with the concerns.\\n\"I guess what it really comes down to is that the farm needs to have a pristine area because we need water that\\'s as clean as possible and therefore we can\\'t afford to do anything to harm the water from that area,\" he said.\\n\"These animals are absolutely and totally reliant on having clean water.\"\\n\\nFlower growers surprised at banned-seed list\\nCut-flower growers are calling for more time to comment on draft changes to seed import regulations.\\nFor the past two months, Biosecurity Australia has been reviewing the Permitted Seeds List.\\nBut tropical flower growers, like Alan Carle, say the review has caught many growers by surprise.\\n\"We are in a process, a review process to dramatically restrict the number of plants and seeds which may be brought into the country in the future,\" Mr Carle said.\\n\"Effectively, it slams the door shut. We should all just band together and ask for a moratorium so we have time to consider and work in a constructive way with Biosecurity Australia and Quarantine to come up with a system which we are all happy with and doesn\\'t create some sort of black market.\\n\"I mean that\\'s the worst thing that can happen to this country is to get things brought in without proper controls.\"\\n\\nUS cattle prices not expected to increase\\nUS Agriculture Department officials say it will take years to recover from Japan\\'s mad cow-related ban on beef and producers there should not expect to see massive price rises.\\nUS Agriculture Department livestock analyst Ron Gustafson says Japan\\'s expected reopening of its market to US beef after it completes audits of US plants next month, will not bring a huge upswing in US cattle prices.\\nMr Gustafson says it will take years to sell pre-mad cow amounts of US beef to Japan, which only buys certain cuts anyway.\\n\"We don\\'t sell whole carcasses to the Japanese or South Koreans, or anyone ... we sell cuts that, largely, we don\\'t have the large demand for here in the US - short ribs, plates and so-forth - the fattier items,\" he said.\\n\\nDrug busting wasps still some time away\\nWasps might be known for their bite, but their highly-tuned sense of smell could make them the sniffer dogs of the future.\\nTrials are under way in the United States to train tiny wasps to detect chemicals.\\nDr Andrew Austin from the University of Adelaide says the idea is feasible and wasps are quick learners, but he can not see them replacing dogs any time soon.\\n\"They\\'ve been able to demonstrate that you can take these wasps and you can train them to recognise that particular chemical,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s a long way from that to actually using this particular wasp in a commercial sense, where you could actually use them as drug busting sort of wasps.\\n\\nHotline to help men cope with depression\\nThe impact of the drought has prompted Beyondblue to establish a national hotline specifically to help men deal with depression.\\nChairman Jeff Kennett says men from country areas are more likely to suffer from depression, but are less likely to admit the problem.\\nHe says the helpline will provide information, treatment and where to get help.\\n\"Unfortunately depression is very prevalent throughout rural Australia and particularly among young men,\" he said.\\n\"So what we hope with this Beyondblue information line is to give men the capacity wherever and however isolated their environment may be for the price of a local call to seek direction and help as to what to do in overcoming their depressive illness.\"\\nThe hotline number, which will be in operation from July 1 is 1300 224 636.\\nWA-based rural financial counsellor Sue Smith says farmers are traditionally bad at managing stress and many cases are ignored.\\nShe says one of the telltale signs is a change in behaviour.\\n\"It\\'s no wonder that people are feeling really stressed at the moment,\" she said.\\n\"The first sign is in the body, somebody will start to feel tired, they\\'ll get headaches, their body will start to ache.\\n\"Sometimes it\\'s other people that notice that they become quiet irritable, they may withdraw from their family and friends.\\n\\nWEA chairman\\'s term extended\\nThe chairman of the Wheat Export Authority (WEA), Tim Besley, will head the regulator for another six months.\\nQuestions have been raised about the authority\\'s effectiveness, in the wake of the AWB scandal.\\n\\nSheep chemical declared unsafe\\nAccess to a chemical commonly used to treat flystrike and lice in sheep will be severely restricted after tests showing it is unsafe.\\nThe review of Diazinon was prompted earlier this year after farm workers complained of headaches and in some cases vomiting when using the chemical.\\nJoan Ashton from the Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority says other chemicals are more costly, but human safety is the priority.\\n\"There\\'s really no way you can mitigate what we think is an unacceptable risk to workers,\" she said.\\n\"Australia\\'s not the only one looking at Diazinon, there\\'s been a range of reviews that have been going on worldwide and it has progressively been discontinued in other countries, as well, along similar lines and for similar reasons for concern, as we\\'ve identified here in Australia.\"\\n\\nAg pilots dispute crash statistics findings\\nNew research from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) says agricultural pilots do not get enough training and are overly represented in crash statistics.\\nThe research, which looked at wire strike accidents where planes hit power lines or other wires, found 65 per cent of low level flying accidents happened in farming.\\nHead of the Aerial Agricultural Association, Phil Hurst, disputes the findings and says the industry has improved its safety record.\\n\\nEconomic forecaster criticised for livestock price estimates\\nThe Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) is again under fire for its forecasts, this time for livestock prices.\\nAnalysts say meat price estimates are probably too low, while production forecasts for beef and lamb are too high.\\nBill Cordingley from Rabobank says the beef figures have not taken poor seasons properly into account.\\n\\nFoster\\'s to sell two wineries\\nFoster\\'s is set to sell two of its wineries, including the iconic Barossa Seppeltsfield Winery in South Australia.\\nAlso on the

uranium mine near Broken Hill has been met with more opposition, with submissions on the project closing today.\\nFriends of the Earth says the South Australian Government will be going back on an election promise if it allows the mine to go ahead.\\nAnti-nuclear campaigner Joel Catchlove says the mine is a risky, short-term operation.\\n\"By supporting it, it puts the Rann Government in quite a difficult situation. Because as there simply isn\\'t a mine at Honeymoon at the moment they\\'re both threatening to break their binding SA platform for government and also it goes against their election promises,\" he said.\\n\"If you\\'ve got a four to six years of operation yet it could be permanent ground water contamination in that area.\"\\n\\nMining company hopes to set up rare earth mine in NT\\nA Northern Territory mining company hopes to have a rare earth mine up and running within five years.\\nThe rare element is a key ingredient for new technology including computer screens, rechargeable batteries and environmentally-friendly hybrid vehicles.\\nArafura Resources has already found an 18.6 million tonne deposit about 130 kilometres north of Alice Springs, but managing director Alistair Stephens says they hope to find more in coming months to meet growing demand.\\n\\nTax Office focuses on timber plantation records\\nCompanies involved in managed investment schemes are under pressure to get crops in the ground before midnight to meet end of financial year deadlines.\\nStaff from the Australian Tax Office have been hovering around timber plantations in the far north of Western Australia to confirm paddock plantings match the accounting books.\\nTom Cullity from Tropical Forestry Services says his company had a last minute scare with the Tax Commissioner at the door and the discovery that two hectares of indian sandalwood was not accounted for.\\n\"Bearing in mind that the Tax Department was coming up today we thought really we\\'d better do something,\" he said.\\n\"I came up and had a look at it and there was obviously a gap there, and said \\'hey boys what are we going to do about this\\' and they all said unprintable words and off we went.\\n\\nShareholders show support for dairy group\\nShareholders have voted down a push to disband Western Australia\\'s only representative dairy group.\\nA resolution was put forward late last year to dissolve the organisation, amid claims it had failed to have an impact on the struggling sector.\\nFollowing yesterday\\'s vote, director Jim Fremantle says there now needs to be an overhaul of the processing sector.\\n\\nRice market regulation ends\\nRegulation of the domestic rice market will end tomorrow.\\nUntil now all rice grown in New South Wales has had to be sold through the single desk held by Sunrice or the Ricegrowers Co-operative.\\n\\nFrost damage may push up avocado costs\\nThe price of avocados could be set to rise, with significant frost damage to crops in the Murray Valley.\\nFreezing conditions a fortnight ago has caused fruit to drop off the trees.\\nJohn Eastoe from Mildura Agricultural Contractors says he has lost 60 per cent of his crop, which had an estimated valued of more than half a million dollars.\\n\"We were sitting on probably our best has crop ever, we\\'ve been lifting our yields for the last three years but as you can see it\\'s all on the ground,\" he said.\\n\\nKatherine School of the Air celebrates anniversary\\nThere will be big celebrations in the Top End town of Katherine tonight, as the School of the Air marks its 40th anniversary.\\nThese days the school serves 220 students.\\nBut in 1966 the first teacher in charge, Ron Smith, began with eight students on HF radio.\\n\"It really made me realise that so much depends on the family,\" he said.\\n\"They need a tremendous amount of encouragement and support. It worked and I was talking to a family in Darwin and their lad was one of the early students, and they have gone on and travelled overseas and studied overseas.\\n\\nMail contractor finally quits 400km mail run\\nIt is a bittersweet day for one outback mail contractor,\\nAfter almost 40 years of servicing properties in south-west Queensland, Cecil Russell is retiring\\nSince 1968 Mr Russell has been making the 400 kilometres round trip from Augathella to Carnarvon Station twice a week and says the scenery is the best part of the job.\\n\"I love the country up there and that\\'s probably why I\\'ve been doing it so long, it\\'s a for ever changing sort of thing, seasons change and yes there\\'s a lot of wildflowers at times,\" he said.\\n\"Every day you get to see a different mob of brumby horses, see quite a few wild dogs and I enjoy just looking at the cattle as I go and that sort of thing.\\n\\nRock lobster fishermen to hang up pots\\nRock lobster fishermen in Western Australia will today pull their pots for the last time this season.\\nMost believe this year\\'s catch was down slightly, but prices are the best they\\'ve seen in years.\\nDongara fisherman Greg Cole

Corporation is predicting a turnaround in the wine industry within the next four years.\\nDavid Brownhill steps down today after six years in his government-appointed role.\\nWith grape growers struggling with poor prices and an oversupply, Mr Brownhill does not, however, expect much improvement in the short term.\\n\"I believe in two years\\' time the light will start to shine at the end of the tunnel, [it] doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s coming out of the tunnel in two years\\' time, but in four years\\' time I believe that you\\'ll be right out of the tunnel and then you\\'ll most probably find we\\'ll be a little bit short of red wine for example,\" he said.\\n\\nFood safety standards need continual improvement, say scientists\\nThe safety of the food that we eat is emerging as a crucial global trade issue, which can open or block access to markets.\\nScientists at the Australian Food Safety Centre say the three main concerns are chemical residues, foreign items in prepared foods and pathogens such as bacteria and viruses.\\nProfessor Tom Ross says pathogenic outbreaks occur at all levels of the food chain from the paddock to the plate and growers, and processors, need to continue to improve safety standards.\\nHe says E. coli bug in the 1980s is an example of how potentially fatal contaminants continue to evolve.\\n\"Twenty years ago that organism had never been seen before,\" he said.\\n\\nAWB vows to fight any kickback lawsuits\\nWheat exporter AWB says it will fight any legal action launched by American farmers in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal.\\nReports suggest the company could face a billion-dollar lawsuit claiming US wheat growers lost trade with Iraq when AWB paid almost $300 million in kickbacks to Saddam Hussein\\'s regime.\\nThe ABC understands the initial case may cover just 20 or so farmers but has the potential to see thousands of US and Canadian farmers join them.\\nIf the action is successful, it could see AWB forced to make a payout triple the value of the kickbacks.\\nBut US Wheat Associates knows nothing of the proposed legal suit at this stage.\\nAWB spokesperson Peter McBride says AWB would fight any such legal suit.\\n\"Such actions are ill-conceived and if any action is formally brought against AWB we will vigorously defend,\" he said.\\nThe ABC understands that it is hard to argue the case that US farmers were hurt by AWB kickbacks, because the US had sanctions against trading with Iraq. \\n\\nSingle desk challenge\\nAWB has challenged the growing number of proposals calling for changes to the single desk export system.\\nNational wheat pool manager David Johnston has told a public debate in Victoria that AWB will accept the outcome from the oil-for-food inquiry.\\nBut he says if AWB\\'s export monopoly or its veto over grain export applications is removed, wheat growers will be the losers.\\n\"The bulk veto, I think, is a core component of the single desk as we know it and if we have people wanting to send wheat into Indonesia or Malaysia or any of our core markets you\\'ll have Australian wheat competing with Australian wheat,\" he said.\\n\\nElectoral boundary change bad for voters: Anderson\\nThe National Party has accused the Australian Electoral Commission of taking the easy way out, by scrapping the federal seat of Gwydir in northern New South Wales.\\nWith a shift in population, New South Wales is required to lose an electorate to accommodate a new seat in Queensland.\\nThe commission wants to merge the seat of Gwydir with Parkes, which will cover almost half the state.\\nBut the retiring Member for Gwydir, former deputy prime minister John Anderson, says the move is a tragedy for country voters.\\n\"I think it\\'s appallingly bad to see people face the prospect of being in a seat that\\'s over twice the size that it is now which makes it far harder for people to access the local member,\" he said.\\n\"This means one less country voice in Canberra and a lesser chance still of being represented around the Cabinet table.\\n\\nNFF \\'lives in hope\\' of trade talks breakthrough\\nThe National Farmers Federation (NFF) is confident there is still life in World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks, despite another failure to reach agreement on agriculture over the weekend.\\nUnited States and European negotiators went into the talks saying they were prepared to move on farm reforms.\\nHowever, negotiators in Geneva say those nations have failed to match their rhetoric with action.\\nAn agreement on agriculture is the crucial first step in securing broader trade deals around industrial goods and services.\\nTrade policy manager with the NFF, Scott Mitchell, says while it is been a frustrating process is not over yet.\\n\"WTO is the main game,\" Mr Mitchell said.\\n\"We live in hope that ministers will go home and reflect on what\\'s happened here this week and will realise that we do have a narrow window of opportunity to make global trading rules better for a long time.\\n\\nCold start to winter cuts rainfall\\nThe freezing start to winter across southern Australia could be causing the ongoing dry weather conditions.\\nIn normal years, cold air from the Southern Ocean collides with warm air from central Australia resulting in cut-off lows, which bring rainfall.\\nBut this year, the systems are not as strong.\\nDr Peter McIntosh, from the Marine Atmospheric Research Centre, says that is because it is colder inland.\\n\"We\\'ve speculated a little bit recently about what might be causing these cut-off lows to decrease in intensity,\" he said.\\n\"We think it is a decrease in the north-south temperature gradient.\\n\\nCoroner blames bushfire on powerline\\nAn electricity provider in New South Wales has been blamed for causing a major bushfire in the state\\'s central west two years ago.\\nThe deputy state coroner has found the fire started near Parkes, when a tree touched a Country Energy powerline.\\nThe 2004 fire burnt 6,000 hectares, causing the death of 690 sheep and the destruction of thousands of hectares of unharvested crops on 28 farms.\\nCraig Ward says he is relieved the four-day inquest quashed rumours that his farming machinery sparked the blaze.\\n\"I just gave evidence that I wasn\\'t in the vicinity of where the fire started,\" he said.\\n\"Through the GPS system on the harvester it plots every two seconds where the harvester has been over the period of time your harvesting.\"\\nMr Ward says he was frustrated by the approach of Country Energy to the trial, which tried to prove his harvester sparked the blaze.\\n\\nOrd River Irrigation Scheme expansion approved\\nThe long-awaited second stage development of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme in Western Australia\\'s far north has been given the green light.\\nTenders have been called by the WA Government, which has settled environmental and native title issues surrounding the development.\\nThe expansion of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme will make 16,000 hectares of irrigated farmland available.\\nThe Government says it is seeking expressions of interest for development of between 7,000 and 16,000 hectares of land.\\nResources Minister John Bowler says land could be available for planting as soon as 2008.\\n\"We believe we can quadruple the amount of hectares placed under agriculture in irrigation,\" he said.\\n\"This will make the Ord Valley one of the most significant agricultural areas in Australia.\"\\n\\nNurse practitioners scheme upsets doctors\\nRural doctors in Tasmania claim they are being devalued by the introduction of nurse practitioners in remote areas.\\nFollowing the lead of other states, the Tasmanian Government will allow nurses to prescribe drugs and undertake some of the traditional tasks of doctors to fill shortages.\\nBut the president of Rural Doctors Tasmania, Eric Calquoun, says nurses should remain an integral part of GP-led health care teams and not be allowed to practice independently.\\n\"I think this is the thin edge of the wedge with this,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re talking about prescribing major drugs, the Poisons Acts regulations are being modified so they can prescribe morphine for palliative care nurses.\\n\\nManaged investment schemes under review\\nConcerns are emerging over the shift in managed investment schemes (MIS) from forestry and vineyards to broader agriculture.\\nPlantings of walnuts and avocados are among those now being offered to investors.\\nRob Dalton, from Avocados Australia, says he is concerned by the push, which could massively distort the market.\\n\"Reviews of MISs have indicated that the investors are in there primarily for the tax deduction and they have much less concern with profitability at the end of the project,\" he said.\\n\"Whereas the normal farmer is in there for a profit and a long-term, sustainable profit.\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran is also concerned about the impact of MISs.\\n\"When they start going into wine grapes and citrus and avocadoes where there is well-established Australian industries, that is of enormous concern,\" he said.\\n\\nWA farmers back single wheat desk\\nThe Western Australian Farmers Federation has called for the single desk wheat marketing system to be kept, even if AWB does not operate it.\\nDespite claims it is not a policy turnaround, it is the first time the federation has appeared to have reservations about AWB\\'s future management of the single desk.\\nPresident Trevor de Landgrafft says the power of veto must stay with the single desk, but who manages it has come under scrutiny.\\n\\nFeedlot demand outstrips grain production\\nQueensland feedlot owners are being told they may have to buy grain to feed cattle from Western Australia, if local production does not increase.\\nThe Department of Primary Industries says demand for feed grains like barley, sorghum and wheat is expected to outstrip local supplies five out of every 10 years.\\nKym McIntyre says feedlots already consume about 2 million tonnes of grain a year, with a further 1 million tonnes likely to be needed over the next five years.\\n\\nFeral pigs destroy Ingham crops\\nFarmers in north Queensland say they are being overwhelmed by feral pigs.\\nIngham cane farmer Tony Palmas believes the devastation of cyclone Larry could have forced many pigs out of their usual haunts to find food.\\nMr Palmas says he has lost crops worth up to $20,000.\\nHe says shooting the pigs is not working and there is no fruit available to use in traps.\\n\"We used to get bananas from north like Innisfail and Tully but for the moment there\\'s no bananas coming from there and there\\'s no mangoes or anything like that,\" he said.\\n\\nLocust fears prompt chemicals buy-up\\nFollowing warnings Western Australia is facing a huge locust plague this spring, the State Government has allocated more than $3 million towards the purchase of chemicals to control plagues.\\nMinister for Agriculture Kim Chance says if untreated, locusts could cost the state more than $100 million.\\nIt is thought big summer rains have contributed to heavy egg laying this year.\\nMr Chance says farmers have to prepare for major damage.\\n\"It\\'s not, in terms of area, quite as big as the spring 2000 infestation was, which covered about, looks to me on the map, two to three times the areas,\" he said.\\n\\nVegMachine gives farmers eye in the sky\\nLandholders across the northern rangelands of Australia can now use satellite monitoring to keep track of environmental changes on their properties.\\nThe new system, which is called VegMachine, has been trialed across 80,000 square kilometres in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.\\nNT Government researcher Luke Peel wants to see the free computer software program used more widely.\\n\"It gives you a birdseye view of the property,\" he said.\\n\"The idea is the mystery of satellite imagery, what it can say and do is being exposed back.\\n\"It still hasn\\'t got to the point where we can actually work out kilograms per hectare on the ground.\\n\"But, it certainly gives an idea of how productivity can be related to use of the resources or trapping of the resources available.\\n\"Whether it\\'s the actual vegetation, the soils or the nutrients in the soil.\"\\n\\nLachlan CMA outlines tender process\\nThe Lachlan Catchment Management Authority (CMA) has outlined how the tender process will work for part of its latest round of incentive funding. The latest round opened last month and will close at the end of this month. Kieran Hawker, from the Lachlan CMA, says the tender process will bring a positive outcome for the environment and producers.\\n\\nCrop growth slow across the region\\nThe district agronomist with the Department of Primary Industries, Jan Edwards, says frosts in Cowra have seen germination of wheat and canola crops slow down. Ms Edwards says weeds will be a big problem as a lot of crop was dry sown and so weeds will emerge with the crops. This will be similar to last year. \\n\\nTruck hits mob of sheep\\nA warning to motorists across the region. A truck hit a mob of 5,000 sheep near Condobolin, killing 15 lamb wethers yesterday morning. Police say the drover was moving the stock on the West Wyalong Road south of Condobolin when they were hit by the concrete truck. Police says it is believed the truck driver did not take notice of stock moving signs. The driver is to be issued with an infringement notice for failing to give way to stock.\\n\\nDraft chicken meat import ruling worries industry\\nThe chicken meat industry says a decision to allow imports into Australia could pose an unnecessary risk to consumers.\\nIn a draft import risk analysis, Biosecurity Australia recommends allowing uncooked chicken meat into the country, as long as exporting countries can prove they are free of diseases, including bird flu.\\nBut Dr Andreas Dubs, from the Australian Chicken Meat Federation, is questioning whether Australia can be certain about another country\\'s disease status.\\n\"That is not a simple matter,\" he said.\\n\"It really comes down to the confidence that we can have with the systems in place which in the past I suppose has been shown to be somewhat questionable.\"\\nWhile Australian quarantine officers usually double-check disease free claims from other countries, some say that is not always a guarantee.\\nPeter Scott, from the Australian Veterinary Poultry Alliance, says authorities rely on getting accurate information from producers.\\n\"Regulatory authorities can only go on the information provided to them and in some cases that may not be accurate,\" Mr Scott said.\\n\"We do see overseas quite a bit of product moving through countries.\\n\"In other words, while you believe you\\'re getting product from a particular country it may be coming in via another country.\"\\n\\nAnimal-based fertilisers threaten BSE status: vet\\nTasmania\\'s chief vet says Australia\\'s status as being free of mad cow disease (BSE) could be threatened by the indiscriminate use of animal-based pasture fertilisers.\\nA number of cattle deaths from botulism in Tasmania have been attributed to the use of poultry litter as a fertiliser.\\nDr Rod Andrewarthur says although it is a legal product, the litter must not be used before the end of the official withholding period to ensure cattle do not ingest any lingering animal protein.\\nHe says under BSE protocols, no animal protein can be fed to cattle.\\n\"We sell our meat to the world as a premium because we are free of diseases like mad cow disease,\" he said.\\n\"We are under audit from other countries like the European Union to make sure that we\\'ve got all the checks and safeguards in place prevent the development of the disease.\\n\\nProcessing delays force saleyard\\'s NLIS overhaul\\nProcessing delays of up to 24 hours have forced Australia\\'s biggest saleyards to overhaul its National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) infrastructure.\\nWith 11,000 cattle on offer today, new in-pen scanning is being put to the test at the Roma Saleyards in Queensland.\\nA year after NLIS became mandatory in the state, the saleyards\\' board is scrapping two run-through scanners worth $270,000.\\nWhile they read tags with 99 per cent efficiency, large volumes of cattle mean even minor misreads could cause huge disruptions.\\nBrisbane-based company Livestock Link has been contracted to pick up any missing tags and non-reader tags more efficiently, by pre-scanning cattle before sales in pens.\\n\\nEthics campaigners push for teminator gene ban\\nGene ethics campaigners are lobbying the Federal Government to ban the development of terminator technology in Australia.\\nThe process would stop seed from breeding naturally, forcing farmers to buy new stocks each year instead of growing their own.\\nMore than 10,000 people have signed a petition claiming genetic engineering companies will have monopoly power if the technology is introduced.\\nThe Government has said it will accept development applications on a case-by-case basis.\\nHowever, Bob Phelps from the GeneEthics Network says that is not acceptable.\\n\"There\\'s clearly strong public sentiment that the terminator is not acceptable,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re submitting those petitions to the federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran and we\\'re saying to the Australian Government we want you to align the Australian Government policy with the global view that it\\'s unacceptable and that the global ban on terminator should remain.\"\\n\\nVFF pushes for single wheat desk changes\\nThe Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF) has joined growing calls for changes to the single desk for wheat exports, in the wake of the oil-for-food Inquiry.\\nUnder its plan, wheat exporter AWB Limited and AWB International would be split, with international wheat sales returned to farmer control.\\nThe VFF will seek endorsement for the proposal from the Grains Council of Australia later this month.\\nVFF grains group president Ian Hastings says the plan addresses concerns about governance of the system, and payments to growers from the national wheat pool.\\n\"We\\'re talking about separation of AWB International and making sure that AWB International continues to have the legislative monopoly for exports of wheat,\" Mr Hastings said.\\n\\nFodder exports demand raises local prices\\nA booming export fodder market is good news for growers but farmers looking to feed livestock in Australia are facing high prices and short supply.\\nLucerne prices have almost doubled since November to around $300 a tonne, while hay prices are up between $30 and $40 a tonne.\\nColin Peace, from the Fodder Industry Association, says drought in the US and Canada is helping to boost exports, at the expense of the domestic market.\\n\"Those two markets often clash for supply so I think you could anticipate that certainly continuing,\" he said.\\n\"There are always opportunities for stocks that are destined for export to be diverted for domestic demand.\\n\\nAWGA seeks unified wool industry vision\\nThere are calls today for a single vision for the wool industry, uniting research, development and commerical operations to pull it out of the current slump.\\nThe Australian Wool Growers Association (AWGA) says the industry\\'s four main bodies - Australian Wool Innovation, Australian Wool Services, the wool testing authority, and wool exchange - are too inward-looking and duplicate services.\\nAWGA chairman, Martin Oppenheimer, says industry leaders should follow the lead of the sheepmeat industry, which turned its fortunes around with a strategic plan 10 years ago.\\n\"We\\'ve got many different grower-owned or funded companies and they\\'re all heading off in their own directions,\" he said.\\n\"They\\'ve got different strategies.\\n\\nTruck crash prompts stock movements warning\\nPolice in New South Wales are warning drivers to be more careful on country roads, after a crash involving a cement truck and a mob of 5,000 sheep.\\nThe mob was being run along a stock route in the state\\'s central-west.\\nDetective Senior Constable Andrew McGrath says police believe the driver ignored stock warning signs.\\n\"A vehicle travelling on a road about 15 kilometres from Condobolin collided with a mob of sheep that were being driven along the road, with 15 fatalities,\" he said.\\n\"The driver of the truck I believe will be issued with an infringement notice for failing to give way to stock.\\n\"Because the conditions have been so dry there are a lot of mobs moving around on the roads so people should be wary when they are travelling on country roads.\\n\\nNullabor pastoralists granted rent subsidies\\nPastoralists on the Nullarbor who are suffering through drought conditions have been offered a sweetener by the West Australian Government.\\nThey have been told they are not eligible for exceptional circumstances funding, but the Government will contribute $80,000 towards pastoral lease rents and agriculture protection rates.\\nPastoralist Rod Campbell says the money is welcome but pastoralists still believe they should be eligible for EC funds.\\n\"We\\'re mystified about the criteria etc but I think the Minister\\'s addressing that very nicely,\" he said.\\n\\nInquiry likely to recommend geosequestration: researcher\\nResearchers believe a federal Parliament inquiry will help find funding for more projects to stop greenhouse gases from coal, oil and gas fields entering the atmosphere.\\nThe House of Representatives Science and Innovation Committee will investigate the benefits and risks of geosequestration, which is capturing carbon dioxide from mining and storing it underground for millions of years.\\nTrials are being carried out in Victoria\\'s Otway Basin and off the Western Australian coast.\\nDr Peter Cook, from the Co-operative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies, says studies are making progress.\\n\"We\\'re very confident that that inquiry is going to endorse the use of this technology as one of the options for decreasing CO2 emissions,\" he said.\\n\\nWine grape ethanol trial under way\\nA 12-month trial producing ethanol from wine grapes has begun in South Australia.\\nTarac Technologies in the Barossa Valley currently distills alcohol from winery waste.\\nThe company will supply South Australian Farmers Fuel with 100,000 litres of biofuel over the next 12 months.\\nSpokesman Chris Zajac says it remains to be seen if the process can be economically viable.\\n\"The reason we\\'ve decided to run the trial is to basically see how it performs against other ethanols in the marketplace,\" he said.\\n\\nHayes to head international wine body\\nAn Australian has been named president of the peak international body representing winemakers and grapegrowers from 42 nations.\\nPeter Hayes will head up the International Organisation for Wine and Vine for the next three years.\\nThe organisation sets industry standards and regulations for all member countries\\nMr Hayes, a director and former chief executive of the Grape and Wine Research Development Council, says he was taken aback by his appointment.\\n\"I find it a bit surprising quite frankly, but I think it is a sign of the times,\" he said.\\n\\nConsumers switch to Homebrand products\\nNew figures show Homebrand products like milk, sugar and butter already account for more than 50 per cent of sales through the major supermarkets.\\nFrozen and canned Homebrand vegetables and dried fruits are also becoming more popular, according to research by accountancy firm KPMG.\\nFood processors are starting to feel the pressure, as supermarkets aim to fill one-third of their shelves with their own labels.\\nKPMG\\'s Adrian Arundell says the processing sector will shrink, as other brands disappear.\\n\"Some of them are fighting head on against it, some of them are actually working with it,\" he said.\\n\\nTin mill\\'s closure to force can imports\\nIn a further blow for the manufacturing industry, tinned fruit and vegetable processors will have to import cans from next year, after the closure of Australia\\'s only tin mill.\\nHigh iron ore prices have lead BlueScope Steel to shut its Port Kembla mill.\\nThat will force canneries to either import tin or look for alternative packaging.\\nThe head of the Food and Grocery Council, Dick Wells, says increased costs are putting manufacturing under a lot of pressure.\\n\"People need to be aware that it\\'s tough all the way and there\\'s no easy life here,\" he said.\\n\"If we\\'re not innovative in this country in looking for ways to take costs out of the structure and produce products that consumers see additional benefits in, then there won\\'t be a future.\"\\n\\nOrganic farmers eye overseas markets\\nThe United States, Europe and South-East Asia are potential markets for Australian-grown organic products, according to a report launched last night.\\nThe report by the Rural Industries and Development Corporation looks at the demographics of consumers, and what drives them to buy organic food.\\nAndre Leu, from the Organic Federation of Australia, says in the long-term, China will be a major market, although Australia will struggle to compete with its domestic production.\\n\"The latest figures that we have from China show that their industry is worth $US8 billion, which makes them one of the largest organic markets in the world,\" he said.\\n\\nFarmers dispute Costello\\'s federalism reform plans\\nThe New South Wales Farmers\\' Association is backing Federal Treasurer Peter Costello in his criticism of Australia\\'s three-tiered system of government, but does not agree with his plans to change it.\\nMr Costello has triggered national debate on federalism, by wanting to wrestle all responsibility for utilities and the economy from the state governments, reducing them to branch offices.\\nMal Peters, from the association, says giving more power to Canberra is not the answer, and is calling for full-scale reform of Australia\\'s system of government.\\n\"Any further centralisation of power into New South Wales is not good,\" he said.\\n\"I mean the closer the government gets to the people the better the government is, and that\\'s well recognised by all players in the state and federal spheres.\\n\\n\\'Iron Boomerang\\' plans onshore iron ore processing\\nThe resources sector is investigating a $55 billion proposal to process iron ore in Australia from 2011.\\nThe \\'Iron Boomerang\\' would be a privately-funded 3,000 kilometre railway to link iron ore deposits in Western Australia with coal fields in north Queensland\\'s Bowen Basin.\\nBlast furnaces to be build at either end of the tracks would produce pig iron for the export market.\\nAn international trade delegation is touring the town of Bowen today to investigate the project.\\nShane Condon, from Project Iron Boomerang, says supply chain savings alone could be worth $2 billion per year.\\n\"When trains run empty and ships are coming back from China, or in the Pilbarra, or in the coal fields of Queensland, the return trip for these giant empty trains and ships is 45 per cent of the total trip cost and that is highly inefficient and using fuels unnecessarily,\" he said.\\n\\nCity vet students try country practice\\nVeterinary students in Western Australia have traded the dogs and cats of city practices for a stint on a remote cattle property in the Pilbara region.\\nAbout 1,600 kilometres from Perth, Warrawagine Station is a long way from home for two vet students, who have never done any work with cattle before.\\nBut student Kate Louden says six weeks on 1 million acre station is a unique experience.\\n\"I didn\\'t realise quite how isolated the station is - 300 kilometres from the nearest shop,\" she said.\\n\"We\\'ve been mustering so we\\'ve been moving the yards and drafting the cattle from different blocks.\\n\"[We\\'ve] been up in the plane and the chopper a few times so it\\'s been great.\\n\\nTrucking industry looks to recruit foreign drivers\\nThe trucking industry wants to start employing migrant workers, as driver shortages and an ageing workforce continue to cause problems.\\nCurrent skilled migrant visas do not allow for truck drivers but the Australian Trucking Association (ATA) is confident it can get the industry reclassified as a skilled occupation.\\nThe ATA\\'s Damien MacFarlane says it is a worldwide problem, and Australia will face competition from other countries hoping to recruit drivers.\\n\"You\\'ll find the United States and the United Kingdom are currently facing the same challenge,\" he said.\\n\"There\\'s many drivers being poached from Australia and have gone to either the United Kingdom or the United States to drive.\\n\"It\\'s fine to say let\\'s go and get migrant drivers, where are you going to get them from? And that\\'s going to be the challenge.\" \\n\\nDry conditions see live sheep exports jump\\nDry seasonal conditions in Western Australia have seen a massive jump in live sheep exports from Fremantle.\\nMore than 330,000 sheep were shipped out last month alone.\\nJohn Edwards, from the WA Livestock Exporters Association, says there is a direct link between the increase and the weather.\\n\"I guess farmers have sort of looked ahead of themselves as to availability of feed stocks on farm and very little paddock feed,\" he said.\\n\"They\\'ve most probably made the decision to sell sheep early.\\n\"Possibly we\\'ve seen a lot of sheep come out now rather than in the spring when they traditionally shear and sell off shears.\"\\nMeanwhile, easing cattle prices in the east are providing northern WA producers with competition in the live export trade.\\nTony Cooling, from Landmark in Broome, says Queensland producers are now selling stock overseas.\\n\"Queensland prices have come back a bit, so live export is now competing with the domestic market over there,\" he said.\\n\\n\\'Beef only\\' cattle granted entry to Qld\\nQueensland has opened its borders to cattle from Victoria and the BJD control zone in New South Wales, as long as it\\'s classed as \"beef only\".\\nThe state had previously banned cattle due to concerns over the disease bovine Johne\\'s.\\nCattle which have not been run with dairy cows for five years, or grazed on land which has run dairy cattle within 12 months, will meet the classification.\\nMichael McCormack, from the Cattle Council, says it\\'s a successful outcome.\\n\"Especially for southern producers it\\'s a good news story,\" he said.\\n\\nCanada continues mad cow tests\\nCanadian authorities are continuing tests on a suspected sixth case of mad cow disease (BSE).\\nThe cow was born before feed bans were put in place in 1997, and was discovered under new surveillance programs.\\nFinal tests are due next week.\\n\\nFrost hits Riversun\\'s US exports\\nA company exporting citrus fruit to the United States says shipments are likely to drop 20 per cent this season, due to frost damage in the Murray Valley, Riverland and Riverina.\\nRiversun chairman Peter Walker says supermarkets in the US are aware of the damage to the Victorian and South Australian crops, but he is confident sales will not be affected.\\n\"It\\'s one of the transparencies that Riversun has,\" he said.\\n\"It goes out and tells the customer base that we have procedures and policies in place and it\\'s adhering to them.\\n\"If it\\'s minus two for more than four hours properties are put into suspension until they are assessed to see if there is any damage on that property, so we\\'ve explained that to supermarkets and they are all still on board.\" \\n\\nDairy farmers form collective bargaining group\\nTasmanian dairy farmers who supply food giant National Foods have formed the state\\'s first collective bargaining group.\\nAbout 30 farmers have come together to negotiate future supply and price contracts.\\nThe chairman of the group, Kem Perkins says the move was inevitable.\\n\"It\\'s the only way we could go to negotiate a price because under the rules and the law these days you can\\'t negotiate price as an individual,\" he said.\\n\"You can\\'t even put in on the agenda when you have a suppliers\\' group meeting so the way we\\'ve set it up ... means that we can talk to any company, negotiate with any company and we can take on board any suppliers that conform to the conditions.\"\\nOne of the first jobs for the bargaining group will be to negotiate extra time for next season\\'s price talks.\\n\\nRenewable fuel plant nears completion\\nWork on the nation\\'s biggest renewable fuel plant in Darwin is almost complete.\\nNatural Fuels Australia will import Malaysian palm oil to produce biodiesel later this year.\\nCharles Darwin University was commissioned to compare traditional diesel with a 20 per cent biodiesel blend.\\nResearcher Mark Thiele says emissions were reduced.\\n\"Carbon dioxide emissions went up slightly but primarily because of the reduction in hydro carbon and carbon monoxide,\" he said.\\n\"We also didn\\'t actually notice very much difference in power or torque.\\n\"Particularly at the 20 per cent blend, which is what we were testing, was only about 1 per cent.\"\\nBut Mr Thiele says it is not clear how sustainable it will be to import palm oil.\\n\"From a sustainability perspective it\\'s probably a little bit more complicated,\" he said.\\n\"We have to look at the whole cycle of biodiesel production and the feed stock.\\n\"It was really outside the scope of the research work that we did.\" \\n\\nMary River dam decision outrages farmers\\nFarmers near Gympie remain outraged with the Queensland Government, despite its decision to scale back the size of a proposed new dam on the Mary River.\\nPremier Peter Beattie initially planned a 660,000 megalitre dam, which would have consumed almost 1,000 properties.\\nBut he now says a smaller dam will be built, with the resumption of 500 properties.\\nUnder the three-stage plan, the dam wall would be raised if more water is needed in 2035.\\nBut locals at a public meeting to hear the details were furious, saying they will be left in limbo for 30 years.\\n\"I\\'ve been living here 30 years and been waiting to retire,\" one said.\\n\"I\\'d been retired one week when he dropped this bombshell.\"\\nAnother resident said: \"Some people in stage one will get bought out there\\'s no doubt if they proceed, and so they\\'ve divided the community even more.\\n\"And they left these people in stage two to whither on the vine.\"\\n\\nCompetition will cut farmers\\' market share: study\\nA new report says in the next 10 years Australian farmers will lose market share to developing countries like China, Brazil and India.\\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations have compared 15 commodities.\\nThey have found that as developing nations increase production and become more competitive, countries like the US, EU and Australia will lose out in world agricultural trade.\\nAustralian exports of sugar, beef, rice and pigmeat will be hardest hit, with less impact on wheat and poultry.\\nTrade analyst Peter Gallagher says although world trade rules will play a part, global export competition is on the rise.\\n\"The world is not beating a path to our door looking for primary products,\" he said.\\n\"The opportunities for Australia are now going to be much more in the processed food area and in the fresh foods and ingredients areas.\\n\"It is important that we realise many developing countries are becoming more effective producers of primary products and we need to look at the structure of our own production for the future.\"\\n\\nApple growers look to boost productivity\\nAustralian apple growers are investigating ways to make their orchards more efficient, to compete with the low production costs of other countries.\\nThe industry will set up 60 trial sites around the country to compare different planting styles.\\nThe chairman of Apple and Pear Australia, Darral Ashton, says one option is to double the number of trees per hectare, using dwarf root stock.\\n\"The trees don\\'t take the usual say four or five years to come into production - they come into production very easily,\" he said.\\n\"Because you have so many trees per hectare, each tree doesn\\'t have to carry so many apples to get that high production per hectare.\\n\\nClimate change threatens blackcurrant industry\\nThere is a warning today that Tasmania\\'s niche blackcurrant industry is under threat from global warming.\\nPlant pathologist Steve Wilson says there has been a progressive drop in yields over the past 15 years because of a sharp increase in extremely cold nights.\\nMr Wilson is trialing other black currant varieties in an attempt to boost yields, but says he is not hopeful.\\n\"This, I think, may be the canary in the coal mine,\" he said.\\n\"It is showing that climate change can impact on commercial crops.\\n\"w We\\'ve often thought of climate change as something that can impact on natural populations, but here it is having quite a distinct impact, quite a distinct economic one, on a small industry.\"\\n\\nCopper find excites stock market investors\\nA small copper explorer has shot out of obscurity after discovering rich veins of the metal near Cloncurry, in north-west Queensland.\\nShares in Australian Mining Investment shot from 29 cents seven weeks ago to a top of $10 yesterday, turning it into a billion-dollar company.\\nIt says drilling at its Rocklands copper deposit is continuing around the clock to feed the stock market more news.\\nHartley\\'s mining expert Rob Brierley says little is known so far about the Rocklands deposit.\\n\"Not very much at all - I think that\\'s what captured the imagination of the market,\" he said.\\n\"In fact it\\'s really been a meteoric rise.\\n\"There is a long way for this company to go, but it\\'s great to see that a discovery can still capture the imagination of the investment public.\"\\nShares in Australian Mining Investment are in a trading halt.\\n\\nKorean missile tests boost oil price\\nThe price of crude oil has hit a record high in the United States overnight after North Korea launched a series of missiles into the Sea of Japan.\\nThe price of crude oil settled at a $US75.19 a barrel.\\nThe prices of gold and silver were also

it off the ground.\\nThe head of the Australian Transport and Energy Corridor, Everald Compton, says governments will be the key to the $4 billion rail network.\\nColes Myer has lodged a submission to a Productivity Commission inquiry into the nation\\'s freight system, saying the inland project would help to make rail more efficient.\\nBut Mr Compton says it is now in the hands of government.\\n\"The Coles Myer thing won\\'t make any difference because other people have said that before,\" he said.\\n\"For instance, Woolworths said it some years ago and governments took no notice of them.\"\\n\\nSnowy inquiry head attacks \\'secrecy culture\\'\\nThe head of a New South Wales Government inquiry into ongoing public ownership of the Snowy Hydro-Electric Scheme says he is trying to break down a culture of secrecy within the authority.\\nA proposed $3 billion float of the state and federal-owned power and irrigation provider was scuttled in the wake of public protest last month.\\nAt a hearing in the Snowy Mountains town of Cooma yesterday, inquiry chairman Gordon Moyes said he heard evidence of a systematic, long-term lack of transparency by Snowy Hydro.\\n\"There\\'s been an absolute failure in terms of communication, not just recently, it\\'s been a culture that\\'s come to us from evidence for at least 20 years,\" he said.\\n\"Who told them not to communicate, who actually authorised the change in nature of the company\\'s businesses?\\n\"They are very significant and important questions and will determine the results of the inquiry.\"\\nThe final report is due on October 27.\\n\\nSea rangers meet in Arnhem Land\\nOne hundred sea rangers from more than 14 different language groups across Arnhem Land are meeting this week,

ideas, the main focus is finding a secure funding to continue their work.\\n\\nKulukuk farm mud crab trial breeds success\\nA Darwin Aboriginal community has succeeded in growing out its first farmed mud crabs, as part of a commercial trial.\\nSo far 600 crabs weighing an average of 350 grams have been sold to wholesalers.\\nThe trial is part of a Commonwealth Government Shared Responsibility Agreement.\\nThe Kululuk farm employs eight people, including traditional owner Jacqueline Treves.\\n\"We seem to be one of the first people in Darwin to grow our own mud crab farm,\" she said.\\n\"Now that we have got one, we just want to make it work for us and our children.\\n\"It\\'s important because we want good jobs for younger Indigenous people and for our own children.\\n\\nCountry women gather for field day\\nAlmost 150 women made their way to Buntine in the West Australian Wheatbelt for the annual Liebe Women\\'s field day yesterday.\\nThose who attended say it was a good opportunity to get away from the farm and socialise with other farming women who are also struggling with the dry start to 2006.\\n\"These sorts of days are even more important when you realise you\\'re actually not alone and that everybody\\'s going through the same pain,\" said Sally Lee from the Wubin district.\\n\\nUS growers slam \\'sham\\' Australian wheat deal\\nUS Wheat Associates has accused Australia of putting together a sham deal to sell wheat to Iraq.\\nLoading has begun in Geelong of the first shipment of wheat to Iraq since a ban was imposed on trade with AWB earlier this year.\\nUS Wheat Associates claims the Wheat Australia consortium\\'s 350,000 tonne contract is just a way for AWB to get around the ban.\\nIt accuses AWB of selling to Iraq from its wheat pool through the consortium.\\nRebecca Coleman says AWB still controls the pricing.\\n\"We think that the Wheat Australia situation is pretty much a shell game, a sham and a way that allows for AWB to continue to funnel wheat to Iraq and avoid the sanctions that are currently in place,\" she said.\\nMs Coleman says Iraq is now one of the US\\'s top 10 wheat customers.\\n\\nDry weather hits WA grain harvest\\nWestern Australian broadacre farmers could be confronting one of their worst harvest seasons in history, after another month of warm and unseasonably dry conditions.\\nThe state\\'s grain handler and marketer, Co-operative Bulk Handling, had earlier predicted that summer subsoil moisture would help produce a crop of around 11 million tonnes, despite an historically dry start to winter.\\nBut operations manager David Fienberg says the entire state\\'s yield could now be as low as 7 million tonnes.\\n\"What we\\'re concerned about is keeping farmers on farm and of course that directly relates to their profitability and of course that comes from volume,\" he said.\\n\"My gut feeling is that lupins are going to be considerably down compared to where they might have been given that early break in summer, I think canola also going to be substantially down.\"\\n\\nPoor harvest sends farmers to other jobs\\nAs the dry spell continues in Western Australia, young farmers are already starting to consider their options off-farm.\\nMany farmers are opting not to put a crop in this year.\\nWes Teakle, from Northampton, is going to build sheds because there is no money to be made on the land this year.\\n\"I know of half a dozen guys, just off the top of my head, that are doing the same thing that I\\'m doing and looking for alternate work,\" he said.\\n\"Unfortunately there\\'s not enough room for all of us in a small town like Northampton or Geraldton.\\n\\nCowra abattoir cleared over sackings\\nThe Cowra abattoir in New South Wales has been cleared over its decision to dismiss 29 employees under the new WorkChoices laws, and re-hire some under a different award.\\nThe Office of Workplace Services has found the company did not break the new laws, and its actions would still have been lawful under the old legislation.\\nThe Federal Government says it has been vindicated by the ruling.\\n\\nAnderson urged to put off retirement\\nFormer deputy prime minister John Anderson is reportedly being urged by the National Party to shelve his retirement plans, to try to stop his federal seat from being abolished.\\nThe Nationals say the Australian Electoral Commission\\'s plan to merge the Gwydir electorate with Parkes in New South Wales is an attack on country Australia.\\nAs well as urging the commission to hear community concerns firsthand, Gwydir Electorate Council chairman, Mark Coulton, wants people of all political persuasions to lobby against the proposal.\\n\"John made the point yesterday that if he was still the deputy prime minister, would Gwydir have been abolished?\" he said.\\n\"I think everyone knows the answer would be no, so whether John stays or not is a different issue.\\n\"A simple solution like that I think we\\'re too far down the track for that.\" \\n\\nCommonwealth urged to heed environmental management survey\\nThe first survey of how farmers are managing the environment shows more than 90 per cent are undertaking improvement works.\\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics research also shows most farmers consider weeds, pests and native vegetation to be their biggest concerns.\\nFarmer groups say the findings should influence the Federal Government, which is deciding how to fund natural resource management.\\nCorey Watts, from the Conservation Foundation, says a range of factors influence the amount of time and money farmers spend on conservation works.\\n\"A lot has to do with the ability of people to be able to receive the kinds of resources that they need to plan and undertake works at different scales,\" he said.\\n\"Drought is a big one - a number of parts of the country are in drought and that really does stuff up people\\'s ability to do what needs to be done in the long-term.\\n\\nRural Commodity Index rises 8pc\\nAgricultural commodity prices remain strong, with the Westpac-National Farmers Federation Rural Commodity Index up nearly 8 per cent compared to this time last year.\\nDairy is the only sector which has fallen below last year\\'s level.\\nIn the past month, barley, canola, cotton and wool have gone up, with small falls in sugar and beef.\\nJustin Smirk, from Westpac, says while prices are pretty good at the moment, next year could be a different story if the world economy slows down.\\n\"However, as you move into 2007, those positive price responses will mean you\\'ll get a supply response,\" he said.\\n\"In addition, with interest rates around the world rising, does suggest it will be a softer year.\\n\\nRig demand delays geosequestration trial\\nResearchers say the first Australian trial of technology to try to trap greenhouse gases underground is being delayed.\\nThe $30 million geosequestration project in south-west Victoria aims to test whether carbon dioxide from coal burning power stations and gas mining can be stored underground.\\nThe Federal Government has funded the project as one of its preferred ways of combating climate change.\\nThe project\\'s leader, Dr Peter Cook, says preliminary tests are being carried out but he does not expect to be able to start pumping carbon dioxide underground until next year.\\n\"A lot of people want to drill for oil at the moment so it\\'s a bit hard to get rigs,\" he said.\\n\"Also it\\'s a constraint on us that costs have generally gone up.\\n\"We\\'re not a major company, we\\'re a research organisation with limited funds so we have to be rather careful the way that we use those funds.\\n\\nCattle killers thought highly organised\\nPolice in Western Australia suspect there may be an organised network killing pastoral cattle to sell their meat.\\nSeven cows have been reported butchered on Pilbara stations in the past month, and police believe there may be more which have not been reported.\\nPastoralist Richard Climas, from Mardie Station 150 kilometres west of Karratha, says cattle theft is becoming a regular occurrence.\\n\"I\\'ve found a few carcasses, generally only the legs and hide left, and they\\'ve taken the whole lot,\" he said.\\n\"It happens quite often. A good bull at the moment is probably worth $600, $700 a beast, it adds up pretty quick.\\n\"What else are they doing while they\\'re out there?\\n\"If they\\'re brazen enough to kill a beast what else are they going to be doing while they\\'re out and about?\\n\"We\\'ve had solar panels stolen and all sorts of stuff stolen.\"\\nFurther north in the Kimberley, the state\\'s stock squad says there has been significant cattle thefts over the past 12 months.\\n\\nCane smut found on 30 properties\\nSugar cane smut has now been found on 30 farms in the Childers area of south-east Queensland.\\nThe disease, which can cause major crop losses, was found for the first time on the east coast less than a month ago.\\nChris Adriaanson, from Queensland\\'s Department of Primary Industries, says the disease will not be eradicated.\\nHe says in the future, farmers will have to rely on resistant crop varieties to eliminate the impact of the disease.\\n\"It depends on what you define as eradication,\" he said.\\n\"If eradicating means biologically extinguishing the disease, then that\\'s never been the objective, it\\'s not part of the way we have to do this business.\\n\\nAbattoir closure to impact on livestock producers\\nLivestock producers in South Australia\\'s north say they will be hit by higher freight costs, after the closure of Conroy\\'s abattoir at Port Pirie.\\nThe plant closed on Friday and sold to T and R Pastoral, which has no plans to reopen it in the short-term.\\nOne hundred people were employed at the abattoir.\\nSandy Morris from Yardea Station in the Gawler Ranges says it will cost him up to $5 a head more to send stock to the meatworks at Murray Bridge instead.\\n\"The impact on us will be that we won\\'t have the option to send them to Pirie which is the closest abattoir for us,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'d have to send them on to Murray Bridge, which would be double the amount of freight.\\n\"I\\'m not quite sure how far Murray Bridge would be from Pirie but it would have to be another 250 [kilometres] I\\'d imagine. Probably looking at something like $2.50-$5.00.\"\\nMeanwhile an abattoir at Stanthorpe, in southern Queensland, says it had to temporarily shut down this morning after temperatures dropped to -20.\\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has reported temperatures of minus six at nearby Warwick and Applethorpe.\\nJohn Allan from Don Allan and Co says the abattoir\\'s hot water system froze.\\n\"We still haven\\'t started work because the cold outside froze the pressure of the steam inside our steam valves,\" he said.\\n\"It just blew from sheer pressure, so that\\'s letting all the steam out now, so we have to replace that now.\\n\\nAustralians crave roast dinner: anthropologist\\nA visiting anthropologist claims the Australian love of a good roast dinner is healthy and in our genes.\\nDr Lionel Tiger is being sponsored by Meat and Livestock Australia, which has run a campaign linking human brain evolution to the consumption of meat.\\nDr Tiger says a survey has found 78 per cent of Australians rate a roast as among their all-time favourite meals and it is a more natural craving than those for sugar and fat-rich processed foods.\\n\"Australian beef is grass-fed and a lot of the hostility to beef depends in part on the American style of making beef which is grain-fed and therefore much fattier,\" he said.\\n\\nCitrus growers set to export to China\\nStrict quarantine measures have finally been agreed upon to send citrus fruit into China, with the first exports due to leave later this month.\\nGrowers had hoped China would help solve some of Australia\\'s oversupply problems, but Judith Damiani says it is not yet known how much fruit will be exported this year.\\nMs Damiani says prices are also uncertain.\\n\"The quarantine requirements make it fairly difficult to put a lot of volume of fruit into that China market,\" she said.\\n\"So we will have to start very slowly, we\\'ll have to do some trial shipments initially and after two years we will have to look at amending the protocol and making it easier to ship there.\"\\nRichie Roberts from Renmark says his fruit company will start packing fruit for China early next week.\\n\"We\\'re very keen to get several containers to China just to test the market because there\\'s so much work that the industry\\'s put in to get access,\" he said.\\n\\nWine exports jump\\nWine exports jumped 12 per cent during the last financial year but prices suffered, according to new figures from the Wine and Brandy Corporation.\\nSeven hundred and thirty eight million litres were exported, with wineries selling a large amount of bulk wine to reduce surplus stocks.\\n\\nCotton properties fail to sell\\nTwo large multi-million dollar cotton properties in south west Queensland have failed to sell at auction.\\nThe Queensland Government had planned to buy the farms to return water to the Murray Darling Basin, but withdrew because it did not have the support of the New South Wales or Federal Governments.\\nThe properties, Clyde and Ballandool, with water licences totalling 58,000 megalitres were expected to make about $60 million at auction on Friday.\\nBallandool was passed in at $20 million, while Clyde is still under negotiation at $27 million.\\nIan Cush from the New South Wales Irrigators Association says the properties have little stored water and growers could not afford to invest and not have a return.\\n\\nCode of conduct for pig welfare criticised\\nThe animal rights group Voiceless has criticised the Federal Government\\'s draft code of conduct for pig welfare, claiming it is inaccurate and limits public consultation.\\nVoiceless says the proposed code invites the public to make submissions through a survey which restricts objections to things like sow stalls.\\nSpokeswoman Katrina Sharman says the code also incorrectly claims other countries have no plans to phase out sow stalls, which is inhibiting public debate.\\n\"The regulatory impact statement which accompanies the code suggests in Denmark, which is a major competitor to Australia\\'s pig meat market, there are no plans to phase out sow stalls,\" she said.\\n\\nGrain production forecasts down\\nStrong global wheat prices are the only bright spot for growers at the moment, with production forecasts down right around the country.\\nQueensland has all but given up on its winter wheat, it is a similar case in WA, while New South Wales and Victoria are doing it tough, with weeds the latest threat to young crops.\\nIt is a gloomy picture right around the country, with South Australia the only state expected to deliver a reasonable harvest.\\nBut grains analyst Lloyd George says with international stocks expected to tighten, good prices should continue.\\n\\nDry Seasons Advisory Committee activated\\nWith Western Australia struggling through its driest start to winter on record, the State Government has activated its Dry Seasons Advisory Committee.\\nTo be formed this week, the committee will include farm bodies, farm management consultants, rural business and local and state government.\\nDexter Davies will again chair the committee, which last operated between 2000 and 2002, and says there are a range of areas to be addressed.\\n\"Identify the worst areas, things like health services, the education services, all the basic services to make sure that we\\'ve got enough there and people have got somewhere to turn to very early in the piece,\" he said.\\n\\nChapman Valley victorious in Powder Puff footy match\\nWhen times are tough it is even more important to have a laugh and there were plenty on hand at the annual Powder Puff footy match in WA\\'s Chapman Valley at the weekend.\\nThe game pits the Valley girls against the Northampton girls in front of a bid crowd of local farmers.\\nAbbey Langley of Northampton kicked a ripper goal on the siren and explains how it all happened.\\n\"One of our players high tackled a Chapman Valley girl and they went to kick it and I was just in the right spot at the right time,\" she said.\\n\"And I marked it. I don\\'t know how far I was out, but I thought I wasn\\'t going to get it.\\n\"But I thought I\\'d better have a crack at it on the siren. So yeah, it was pretty funny. It\\'s good fun.\"\\n\\nOrganiser pleased with beef auction prices\\nCentral Australian beef has attracted record prices at a weekend auction at the Alice Springs Show.\\nThe champion steer carcass, from the Holt family of Delny Station, sold for $6.70 a kilogram.\\nCompetition organiser Nicole Hayes says she was surprise that so many drought-hit pastoralists supported the auction.\\n\"Considering the season, we are pleased with that,\" she said.\\n\"We had to support it so you have sort of got to put in what you have got and considering how dry it is at home, it\\'s good to see.\\n\"We just haven\\'t got the cattle that we would have had in previous years. Our numbers are going to be right down, especially for next year.\\n\"There\\'s not many little calves around which is a bit unfortunate but it\\'s as good as we can do.\\n\\nApple growers take advantage of Italian World Cup win\\nApple orchardists in central western New South Wales are already trying to take advantage of this morning\\'s World Cup win by Italy.\\nItalian-born, but proud Australian orchardist Guy Gaeta says he is looking for white apples to blend with his fruit.\\n\"We have got red and green apples I suppose but unfortunately we haven\\'t got any white ones,\" he said.\\n\\nShip owners back moves for cheaper foreign workers\\nShip owners say the latest move to replace Australian crew members with foreign workers is important for the competitiveness of our exports.\\nCrew members from the MV Stolt, currently docked in Hobart, are refusing to load the tanker in protest at plans to re-flag the vessel and replace them.\\nBut Llew Russell from Shipping Australia Limited says it is cheaper to use foreign workers and the trend is likely to continue.\\n\"We certainly support viable and competitive Australian flagged shipping but this should not be in terms of inhibiting our overseas competitiveness,\" he said.\\n\\nFarm quarantined after BJD find\\nJust when many farmers in Western Australia thought the season could not get any worse, there has been confirmation of a fatal wasting disease in a cattle herd.\\nThe Department of Agriculture and Food says a farm near Albany in the state\\'s Great Southern, has been placed under quarantine, in a bid to prevent further spread of bovine Johne\\'s disease (BJD).\\nThe state\\'s BJD-free status is now under threat.\\nChief vet Dr Peter Buckman says an extensive testing process is now under way to try to trace beef cattle which have been sold off the farm in the past decade.\\n\\nMining company shares continue trading halt\\nShares in Australian Mining Investment remain in a trading halt because of concerns over whether the company has disclosed enough information to the stockmarket.\\nThe Queensland explorer shot from obscurity last week when its shares jumped 2,000 per cent after it discovered rich veins of copper at its Rocklands deposit near Cloncurry.\\nHowever, Hartley\\'s resource expert Rob Brierley says the Australian Securities and Investment Commission is now querying whether the drill results meet market standards.\\n\\nGovt urged to rework fuel tax bill\\nThere are claims today that the Federal Government\\'s complex fuel tax bill could spell the end of the biofuels industry.\\nThe renewable fuel sector says investors are being turned away because the bill has reduced its access to the market since its introduction on July 1.\\nBob Gordon from Renewable Fuels Australia says the Federal Government needs to go back to the drawing board to make the legislation fairer.\\n\"Unlike the rest of the world which is surging ahead with biofuels industry growth and all of those countries that have emerging biofuel industries have high tariff regimes to protect them against imports until they\\'re established in the market,\" he said.\\n\"Australia is going in the opposite direction. Progress is going to freeze in Australia, if not worse.\"\\nA Victorian dairy company says with the a growing number of biofuel projects on the drawing board, companies will have to convince the Federal Government to offer tax incentives.\\nJohn McLean from the Warrnambool Cheese and Butter Factory says his company wants to use bio-gas from its cheesemaking operation as a dual fuel for its milk tankers.\\n\\nVFF group calls for restructure\\nThere are calls today for a major restructure of the Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF).\\nThe VFF\\'s livestock group says its membership has fallen from 6,000 to 3,000 and it may no longer be able to afford representation on peak industry bodies like the Sheepmeat Council.\\nGroup president Ailsa Fox says the VFF needs to change the way it allocates its budget.\\n\"There\\'s two ways of dealing with this question, whilst we need more funds, our executive officer identified that there is perhaps resources that could be shared a lot better within the organisation,\" she said.\\n\\nSheep thefts may lead to more livestock truck checks\\nPolice on South Australia\\'s Eyre Peninsula say they may resort to checking every livestock truck on the region\\'s roads after a growing number of sheep thefts.\\nAbout 1,200 sheep have been reported stolen this year, including 250 head from near Wudinna this week.\\nSenior-Sergeant Paul Roberts says all peninsula police stations have been alerted.\\n\"It may well be that we want the staff to stop all stock crates that are moving throughout the local service area and along the highways,\" he said.\\n\\nUS wheat farmers sue AWB\\nSix American wheat farmers have launched a class action against AWB in the United States, claiming the wheat exporter\\'s dealings in overseas markets damaged their own incomes.\\nAccording to media reports, the US wheat farmers are alleging AWB engaged in a global campaign of racketeering, money laundering, fraud and bribery.\\nWhile some of the allegations relate to the Iraq market, others relate to deals in Yemen, Pakistan and Indonesia.\\nThe US farmers are arguing for millions of dollars in compensation, claiming AWB\\'s actions resulted in them being excluded from certain wheat markets and damaged their economic interests.\\nBut law Professor Richard Garnett says even if the action is successful, there are doubts about whether AWB in Australia could be financially liable.\\n\"We don\\'t generally recognise judgments from foreign countries which are punitive or designed to punish defendents, we only recognise judgments which are compensatory, where a sum of money is provided in compensation for losses,\" he said.\\nAWB, which has not yet been served with the writ, says the actions are ill conceived and the company will vigorously defend any claims.\\nMeanwhile the first shipment of 350,000 tonnes of grain through the Wheat Australia consortium is expected to set sail for Iraq this week.\\nBut AWB International says if there is a new tender to supply Iraq it would prefer to strike the deal itself.\\nThe Iraqi Grains Board has refused to deal with AWB because of its involvement in the oil-for-food scandal.\\nBut AWB International chairman Ian Donges is hoping for a change of heart.\\n\"We\\'ll wait for that tender of course and we\\'ll be talking to Iraq in terms of whether the ban still applies to AWB firstly,\" he said.\\n\\nCSIRO begins researching grape quality potential\\nNew equipment is being developed to measure the potential quality of grapes before they are harvested.\\nThe CSIRO has been researching the links between grapes and the quality of the wine they produce, using chemical and sensory analysis.\\nIt is hoped the research can be used to develop bio-sensor technology, which will be used to test grapes at the vineyard or weighbridge.\\nCSIRO scientist Dr Aggie Cox says that should help growers receive fairer prices.\\n\"What we\\'re basically trying to do is look for things that we can measure to be able to tell us what sort of wines those grapes can produce,\" he said.\\n\"And the reason we\\'re doing that is to try and make the wine a lot more consistent so the winemakers have some sort of idea of what that parcel of grape is potentially able to produce in the end.\\n\\nBeekeepers discuss industry\\'s future\\nAustralia\\'s leading beekeepers are in Launceston today discussing the challenges of falling honey prices and the growing threat of disease.\\nIt is estimated that the beekeeping industry is worth $1.7 billion to Australian agriculture, and at today\\'s meeting, apiarists from around the country are deciding how best to allocate the annual half-a-million-dollar research and development budget to protect the future of the industry.\\nChief among concerns is the threat of the verroa mite, which has already decimated the US industry and was found in New Zealand\\'s South Island just three weeks ago.\\n\\nMahogony timber harvest headed for floorboarding\\nThe first commercial timber harvest from far north Western Australia is destined to be floorboarding for Perth\\'s housing boom.\\nIndian sandalwood was supposed to be grown in the Ord River pilot project, but the trees were taken over by african mahogany, with 300 hectares now harvested.\\nMax Correy from the Kimberley Timber Company says the mahogany trees seem to enjoy the irrigated growing conditions.\\n\"All the other mahogany plantations, which have more or less been trial plantations are all dry-land,\" he said.\\n\"And of course they are looking at two to two and a half, maybe three times the growth time frame that we are.\\n\\nWwoofers on the increase in Aust\\nAustralia now has the largest number of wwoofers in the world.\\nThe term wwoofing stands for \"willing workers on organic farms\" where travellers help with farmwork in exchange for food and board.\\nAustralia has around 11,000 wwoofers working on 1,600 farms each year.\\nJordyn Rettinger, a 22-year-old from Ontario in Canada says it is a great way to see the world.\\n\\nFungi used in weed kill trials\\nScientists are closer to understanding how native fungi can kill introduced weeds across northern Australia.\\nTrials in north Queensland have identified 10 varieties of fungi which have been causing dieback in parkinsonia, a weed which threatens 75 per cent of Australia\\'s north.\\nVictor Galea from the University of Queensland says it is unusual to find a native organism that can be used as a cheap biological control agent.\\n\"We suspect that a lot of these fungi which are in the soil are adapted to live in that situation and parkinsonia is not adapted so well,\" he said.\\n\\nWool price increases predicted\\nSome good news for the wool industry today, with analysts tipping good price increases in the second half of the year.\\nRetail demand is down in key markets like the United States and Japan, but economic conditions in most wool consuming countries are forecast to improve, which should see sales pick up.\\nWith most Australian auction centres entering the winter recess, chief economist at Woolmark, Chris Wilcox, says confidence for the rest of the year is high.\\n\"We would expect to see a similar price gain to what we\\'ve seen in the first six months,\" he said.\\n\"It is a fairly positive outlook, in fact Woolmark business survey results, the last survey we did was the most positive we\\'ve seen in nearly five years. And I think we\\'ll see more of that in the coming few months.\"\\nMeanwhile, the latest figures from Australian Wool Innovation show wool production is set to fall away in Western Australia by about 7 per cent over the next year, with a minor increase in the eastern states.\\nAlthough dry conditions are affecting most of the country, sheep numbers are not expected to decline any further.\\n\\nStudy shows more severe droughts ahead for Aust\\nNew research into the sun suggests eastern Australia could face more severe droughts over the next 500 years.\\nA study at the University of New England in New South Wales has shown a link between solar cycles and rainfall patterns, which can be used in conjunction with the southern oscillation index to more accurately predict droughts.\\nAssociate Professor Robert Baker says fewer sunspots or cold patches on the surface of the sun may mean the eastern states are headed for drier times in the long term.\\n\\nLive export industry generating $1.8b a year\\nThe live export industry is fighting back against animal rights activists with an industry backed survey released today detailing the part it plays in the national economy.\\nLive exports have been under attack from activists for some years and the Federal Government has banned exports to some Middle East countries following animal cruelty concerns.\\n\\nLamb exporter releases new contract conditions for producers\\nA major Western Australian lamb exporter admits it has taken a risky step by negotiating new contracts for the heavy lamb market in North America.\\nIn recognition of the hard winter across the southern half of the state, meat marketing co-operative WAMMCO has released new contract conditions for producers, allowing for lambs two kilograms lighter.\\nChief executive Des Griffiths says the main challenge is to help producers to continue selling their lambs, despite the lack of winter feed and also hold on to the lucrative export markets.\\n\"In Western Australia particularly, we\\'re at risk of losing it because in the eastern states if they have a reasonable season, the product is available out of there,\" he said.\\n\\nUS wheat futures jump\\nUnited States wheat futures jumped a further 3 per cent last night following growing concerns about their spring wheat crop.\\nContracts on Chicago out until December 2008 have also jumped to nearly $US5.00 a bushel, well above the current spot price.\\nDougal Hunter, from the Australian Stock Exchange, says this points to good domestic prices for the next three harvests.\\n\"There\\'s no doubt the higher prices out in the deferred months, particularly 2007 and 2008 for Chicago have presented selling opportunities both on swaps and on the ASX,\" he said.\\n\"On the ASX at the moment the January contract for milling wheat settled at $218.\\n\\nCattlemen claim best season in years\\nCattlemen south-west of Darwin are hailing their best season in years.\\nThe heavy wet season has seen a growing number of cattle being fattened in the Douglas Daly region.\\nProducer Ian Mcbean says the conditions should see an increase in the number of cattle going into the territory\\'s live export trade.\\n\"It is definitely the best season I have ever seen in the 50 odd years I have been in the Territory, really good growing season,\" he said.\\n\\nStates look to align illegal fishing laws\\nQueensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory are looking at aligning their laws to tackle illegal fishing, as part of a joint effort to tackle the problem.\\nThe Federal Government has also agreed to fund a pilot project, examining the role of Indigenous sea rangers in coastal surveillance.\\nBut Peter Cassells, from International Fisheries, says ultimately there will not be a need for rangers to help because the Government wants to stop illegal fishermen before they reach Australian territorial waters.\\n\"I mean in an ideal world illegal fishers will not get through to the coastal strips,\" he said.\\n\\nCherry growers urged to support levy increase\\nCherry growers say they are facing a tough season, with a lack of overseas markets and a forecast heavy crop.\\nNew fruit fly protocols in Taiwan have closed that market and growers cannot get fruit into China, the US or New Zealand.\\nThe industry now wants to increase its levy from one to eight cents a kilogram to fund research and development, marketing and promotions.\\nTrevor Ranford from Cherry Growers Australia hopes most growers will support the changes.\\nEfforts have begun to tackle fruit fly outbreaks on a national basis for the first time.\\nIn the past, controlling the pest has been left up the states, but the horticulture sector believes there needs to be a more coordinated approach.\\nPlant Health Australia spokesman Kyle Thoms says there will be a meeting in Canberra next month to kick off the effort.\\n\"There\\'s been a lot of good work done that\\'s been done over many years across all of the states, but this is going to give us a chance, this national program, to bring all those players together,\" he said.\\n\\nConference to focus on sustainability of Indigenous communities\\nThe future of remote Indigenous communities is in the spotlight at a national conference in Perth today.\\nAcross Australia, 250 delegates will attend the conference to look at how to make the communities sustainable.\\nDoctor Martin Anda from Murdoch University says they will not be focusing on past failures,

these far-flung communities,\" he said.\\n\\nKangaroo skin hits fashion capitals\\nKangaroo skin is being promoted by designers and manufacturers in the fashion capitals of the world.\\nA company in Cairns which exports up to 18,000 skins every two months to processors in Spain, France and Italy says the skins are made into everything from clothing to footballs.\\nExporter Ross Gates says the skin is proving popular because of its strength, repellent nature and pliability.\\n\"Quite a number of the upmarket men\\'s shoe manufacturers are starting to manufacturer their shoes from kangaroo,\" he said.\\n\\nUS researchers to grow crops on Mars\\nResearchers in the United States are running trials to see if crops can be grown on the planet Mars.\\nNASA plans to send astronauts to Mars to set up a planetary base, a mission which could last at least three years.\\nResearchers at the University of Florida are looking at which crops might be grown hydroponically on the shuttle during the trial and also in greenhouses on Mars to provide food for the astronauts.\\nProfessor of food engineering Arthur Teixeira says results have been successful.\\n\"I believe research is now available to show that we could probably rely on being able to grow certain varieties of rice, dry beans, soy beans and sweet potato,\" he said.\\n\\nMumbai train explosion behind gold price

alerts to doctor visits could pop up on your television.\\nNew research by the Desert Knowledge Cooperative Research Centre has shown that the TV is almost always switched on in remote communities and improved technology could make sure messages get through.\\nDr Andrew Turk from Murdoch University says the technology would help to improve communication.\\n\"From the results of our survey, TVs seem to be on pretty well all day, now whether people are watching them is another question,\" he said.\\n\"But if we put a message as audio in Idigenous language, people pick up on that even if they\\'re not watching the set and they realise that is something of interest to them, rather than just the general chatter in English.\\n\\nFuel prices changing rural lifestyles\\nHigh fuel prices are changing how rural families live, with some dropping children\\'s sporting commitments and car pooling with neighbours.\\nThe latest figures from the Bureau of Statistics show transport, food and groceries and recreation are the three biggest expenses for rural household budgets.\\nQueensland beef producer Georgie Somerset believes country people spend more on recreation because they are spending more time on the farm.\\n\"Perhaps there\\'s a sense there of \\'well we\\'ll go and do this while it\\'s in town, or we\\'ll take up the opportunity to go to a performance\\',\" he said.\\n\"If you\\'re not going to get away from where you live then you may as well make the most of what you\\'ve got there and so yes I think there probably has been some more spending on things like a DVD machine and a decent TV because they\\'re actually spending more weeks at home and less weeks away on holidays.\"\\nThe New South Wales Irrigators Council says it will withdraw support for the National Water Initiative, unless the federal and state governments make radical changes.\\nThe council\\'s chief executive, Doug Miell, says the initiative is \"off the rails\" and will place a huge financial

which is being sent down the Murray to irrigate vineyards and almond farms, and that they enjoy tax breaks through managed investment schemes (MIS).\\nMr Turnbull says he will raise the issue with Mr Howard.\\n\"I\\'ll take back to the PM the concern that there is in the community, that the managed investment schemes have certain tax advantages,\" he said.\\n\\nRural property values plateau\\nRural property values seem to have finally plateaued after rising by 70 per cent over the past five years.\\nElders rural property expert John Peden says the softer market is more a correction than a direct result of drought or lower farm incomes.\\nWith uncertainty over water allocations, Mr Peden says there is less confidence in the irrigation sector, although the beef industry continues to boom.\\n\"There is normally a slowing in sales volume during the winter. We are experiencing that at the present time, possibly a little more than in previous years,\" he said.\\n\\nDrought relief scheme extended\\nThere is good news today for 25 per cent of drought-hit farmers who rely on off-farm work to maintain an income.\\nLast year the Federal Government relaxed aid rules, allowing primary producers to earn up to $41,000 without affecting their drought relief payments.\\n\\nMining company confident of copper deposit discovery\\nThe directors of mining company, CuDeco, remain confident they have found one of Australia\\'s biggest deposits of copper near

the speakers as they come around the world on what\\'s happening,\" he said.\\n\\nFrost damage blamed for drop in orange crop\\nSouth Australia\\'s navel orange crop will be down by as much as 30,000 tonnes due to frost damage.\\nIndustry officials say the crop could come in at between just 45,000 and 50,000 tonnes.\\nOther varieties including mandarins, lemons, tangelos and grape fruit have also suffered significant losses.\\nCitrus Crop Estimates Committee spokesman Kym Thiel says more damage could still appear.\\n\"For some individuals there may be 100 per cent loss, for others it may only be a certain percentage,\" he said.\\n\\nItalian company doubles Aust wool purchases\\nThe wool industry is claiming a win, following news that Italian fashion giant Benetton will double its purchase

attact research funding to help landholders who do not have any way of curing affected stock.\\n\\nInvestment needed to control buffel grass: expert\\nControl of the introduced pasture buffel grass is proving a major challenge across central Australian parks.\\nFor the past 12 years, Sydney University students have assisted Finke Gorge National Park rangers, south-west of Alice Springs.\\nThe

after suffering a dry June and heavy frosts.\\n\"It hasn\\'t been heavy rain, it\\'s barely been drizzle a lot of the time, it\\'s only made things damp, it certainly hasn\\'t wetted things, barely enough to get my pasture growth going again and it\\'s certainly not enough let us go sowing lucerne with any confidence,\" he said.\\n\\nQld\\nIn Queensland there were some good falls in the parched

poached each year.\\nBrian Jeffriess from the Tuna Boat Owners Association says while illegal fishing has cost them income, the figures show there is more tuna in the wild than previously thought.\\n\"That\\'s a large loss of income over the last 20 years, if the report is correct,\" Mr Jeffriess said.\\n\"That\\'s a worrying situation.\\n\"Strangely enough, if indeed it\\'s true, then

trialed in Okinawa and he hopes the Mossman trial proves equally successful.\\nMr Johnstone says so far only a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the mill and Kristevefourspace and nothing is in writing regarding the breakdown of future profits.\\n\\nTimbercorp, Costas launch Chiquita takeover bid\\nAgri-investment company Timbercorp has announced it is involved in a take-over bid for mushroom and fruit marketing company Chiquita Brands South Pacific.\\nFor the bid, Timbercorp has joined forces with the Costa family to form a company called Tradefresh, which has offered 73 cents per share to buy out Chiquita.\\nThe Costa group already owns 26 per cent of Chiquita shares.\\nIf the bid is successful Timbercorp would end up with a 35 per cent share in Chiquita and the Costa family the remaining 65 per cent.\\nBananas only represent about 15 per cent of Chiquita\\'s normal annual turnover and before cyclone Larry the company marketed about 12 per cent of all bananas sold in Australia.\\nMushrooms are Chiquita\\'s biggest commodity making up about 35 to 40 per cent of its annual turnover, some from the Stanthorpe area in south-east Queensland.\\nChiquita managing director Mano Babiolakis says he has only just heard about this takeover bid so he has advised shareholders not to take any action until it has been carefully assessed.\\nTimbercorp is a specialist investment management company involved in the Australian horticulture and forestry industries.\\nTimbercorp\\'s deputy CEO Sol Rabinowicz believes Chiquita would be a sensible addition to their portfolio.\\n\"Both we and Costas believe that there\\'s an opportunity to join together the strength of the Costa group as one of Australia\\'s leaders in fresh produce, farm management, packing, processing and marketing together with Chiquita\\'s strengths as a category manager particularly in the area like berries, mushrooms and citrus,\" he said.\\n\"We think that it can sit together, they can become a more efficient operator.\"\\n\\nCape York Peninsula: the ideal training ground?\\nSome Cape York Peninsula cattle producers believe far north Queensland properties offer the ideal training ground for young trainees into the industry and they are appealing to the Government to support some sort of subsidised training scheme.\\nThe big side benefit would be properties could access much needed workers for dry season mustering.\\nYesterday Greg Jenkins, from Strathburn Station, brought up the problem of workers and how hard it is to recruit young people to cattle properties in far north Queensland.\\nThe problem is young people can earn more money elsewhere and compared to previous generations, Mr Jenkins believes the youth of today are less inclined to work in remote areas.\\nJay Willmann\\'s family runs Yarraden station near Coen but they have only been there three years after coming up from central Queensland.\\nMr Willmann says on Cape York Peninsula properties the work is intense, varied and exciting so young people learn the ropes a lot quicker than down south.\\n\"I worked in central Queensland a lot, all over stations,\" he said.\\n\"The biggest thing is they didn\\'t have the variety of work that we have up here.\\n\\nFarmers welcome EC assistance extension\\nFarmers across four states have welcomed the Federal Government\\'s decision to extend drought relief until next year.\\nExceptional circumstances (EC) have been extended in 23 drought-declared areas in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.\\nUnder the scheme, farmers and pastoralists who are been battling drought receive income and business support.\\nTiffany Lord, from Yudnapinna Station west of Port Augusta in South Australia, says it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the assistance.\\n\"It\\'s helped out keep us afloat, I\\'m sure that it\\'s helping a lot of other people who are in the same predicament out this way,\" he said.\\n\\nCanola crop estimates cut\\nThe 2006 canola crop estimates have been reduced to 1.4 million tonnes - 50,000 tonnes down on last year.\\nThe Australian Oilseeds Federation says late sowing in many areas, and cold, dry weather during June has led to the lower forecast.\\n\\nBusinessman fined $1.2m over abalone trade\\nA Queensland businessman has been fined a record $1.2 million for his role in an elaborate abalone trading ring.\\nDavid Wei Meng Lee was been found guilty in Hobart\\'s Criminal Court of five counts of illegally possessing abalone.\\nBetween August 2001 and March 2002 the 49-year-old received consignments of dried abalone from Tasmania at his Gold Coast seafood retail outlet.\\nLee is one of 17 people who were charged as a result of a police surveillance program known as Operation Oakum.\\nThe $1.2 million fine is the largest penalty imposed on any of them.\\nIn handing down the fine, Justice Shan Tennant said she thought it unlikely Lee would be able to pay it all.\\n\\n\\'Contractual requirements\\' delay wheat shipment\\nThere have been more delays in shipping wheat to India, with grain from Western Australia under intense scrutiny to ensure it meets tough contractual requirements.\\nQuarantine concerns have held up two previous shipments to India this year.\\nThe latest consignment is being loaded onto a ship at Esperance today, which has been waiting in the bay for more than two weeks.\\nAWB\\'S Western Australian manager, Paul Ryan, says a combination of factors caused the delay.\\n\"There\\'s a very strict and extensive pre-testing and testing program before the vessel is loaded that has to be adhered to under this Indian contract,\" he said.\\n\\nShipping delay to leave US retailers short of fruit\\nThere is a looming shortage of Australian citrus in US supermarkets, after engine problems delayed the third shipment of this year\\'s exports.\\nThe ship was delayed in Port Adelaide by 12 days.\\nSteve Allen, from exporter Riversun, says it will be the first time market demand cannot be met.\\n\"Unfortunately we will run out of fruit for probably a week or less, which means that some supermarkets may go to South Africa but look there is a shortage of fruit in the United States,\" he said.\\n\\nProductivity review results disappointing: Truss\\nState and federal-owned corporations dealing with road, rail, ports and other export infrastructure are under-performing, according to a new analysis by the Productivity Commission.\\nTreasurer Peter Costello has seized on the report as another example of the need for the Federal Government to take control of important national assets, although the Opposition says the Government\\'s track record is woeful.\\nFederal Transport Minister Warren Truss says the review results are disappointing.\\nHe says the mindset within government-owned companies has to change.\\n\"Obviously we expect maximum performance from our services and our utilities - that\\'s essential to build a productive trading arrangement and to ensure that our country is able to pay its way,\" he said.\\n\"It is disappointing that some companies do not perform well,.\\n\"Of course the very act of corporatising a utility doesn\\'t make it profitable.\\n\\nAudit report urges illegal land clearing test cases\\nA new report by the New South Wales auditor-general shows 40 per cent of the 74,000 hectares cleared of vegetation last year was done illegally.\\nWhile satellite images are being used to provide accurate information for the first time, the report shows illegal clearing is not as widespread as conservationists have claimed.\\nAuditor-General Bob Sendt is warning farmers, particularly in western New South Wales, that with new laws, the State Government is in a position to clamp down on illegal clearing.\\n\"The Government and the Department of Natural Resources needs to make it clear to those elements of the rural community that want to continue to clear land illegally that the new legislation does have bite,\" he said.\\n\\nVictorian water traders set new record\\nThere is more evidence of growing agricultural water sales in Victoria, with a record amount of permanent water traded in the state\\'s north-west last financial year.\\nAlmost 26,000 megalitres of additional water moved into the region, mainly from upstream along the Murray River.\\nOwen Russell from Lower Murray Water says most of the new water is being used by almond growers between Robinvale and Nyah.\\n\"We\\'ve seen water come in effectively from out of the Goulburn Murray irrigation district region,\" he said.\\n\\nRain boosts young cattle prices\\nRecent rain across parts of the eastern seaboard has helped to drive up cattle prices.\\nThe Eastern Young Cattle Indicator, a benchmark of young cattle prices across saleyards in eastern Australia, jumped eight cents to 371 cents dressweight last night.\\nAgConcepts Analyst Angus Brown says a tight supply of cattle and increased demand from producers has prompted the increase, which is likely to continue.\\n\"Low supply always forces prices up as lot feeders looking for cattle and processors looking for cattle and restockers are looking for something to put on the grass they are going to have in about a month,\" he said.\\n\\nAustralian, NZ dairy farmers share research costs\\nThey might be rivals in international trade but Australian and New Zealand dairy farmers are about to get a whole lot closer, with a new partnership to share research costs.\\nFollowing support from farmer organisations in both countries, Dairy Australia and New Zealand company Dairy Insight will focus on improving pre-farmgate research, including industry development, education and training.\\nThe head of the Australian Dairy Industry Council, Allan Burgess, says it makes sense to reduce costs.\\n\"We think there\\'s very limited resources available for farmers and things we can do together are going to be more efficient,\" he said.\\n\\nNew Middle East lamb exports record set\\nAustralia has recorded its highest ever monthly sales figures for lamb to the Middle East.\\nIn June, sales hit 824 tonnes - 100 tonnes higher than the previous record.\\nIan Ross, the Middle Eastern manager for Meat and Livestock Australia, says the quality of Australian lamb is recognised by supermarket and restaurant buyers.\\n\"There\\'s a great response now to the flavour of Australian lamb, and also there\\'s a strong awareness of [it],\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve been doing all we can now for some time to encourage the awareness of the safety systems and the traceability, the integrity of the Australian halal system because we are talking about a Muslim community.\\n\\nAlgae project wins renewable energy grant\\nA Queensland company trying to produce biodiesel from algae is among the recipients of $10.5 million in federal grants for renewable energy projects.\\nEnergy Minister Ian Macfarlane says Brisbane company SQC is getting $220,000 for its work with algae.\\n\"The algae produces an oil extract which can then be used for biodiesel,\" he said.\\nThe company wants to commercialise a process which could be suitable for farm dams and irrigation lagoons.\\nThe biggest grant recipient is CSR Sugar\\'s centre at the University of Queensland, which has received $5 million for work to produce a new sugarcane with more fermentable sugar suitable to ethanol and biofuels.\\n\\nInternet helps farmers recruit backpackers\\nVideo conference technology is helping job agencies tap into the backpacker market in Australia\\'s far north-west.\\nOne company has set up remote facilities in Broome, Western Australia, interviewing travelling workers over the Internet and then employing them to work in the farm sector.\\nOne of the regions looking for workers is the east Kimberley, which looks set to have a bumper mango harvest.\\nGrower Lachlan Dobson doubts local labour will meet demand.\\n\"There\\'s guesstimates going around at the moment that Kununurra mango production might be up around 400,000 trays,\" he said.\\n\\nProject Gold to tell farm families\\' stories\\nA youth arts project has been launched in southern New South Wales to stimulate debate about water use and drought.\\nUnder Project Gold more than 30 students will develop digital and media skills by working with the not-for-profit organisation BIG hART.\\nSpokesman Casey Ankers says their new skills will be used to tell the stories of farm families from southern Queensland to northern Victoria.\\n\"What we\\'re looking at doing is skilling up the young people to work with us, work with the BIG hART artists and go out to rural communities and gather narratives from rural families that have been affected by the drought,\" he said.\\n\\nCountries aim to salvage trade deal\\nThe world\\'s most influential trade ministers are meeting in Geneva this weekend to try to resurrect global free trade talks.\\nSix nations, including Australia, will be attempting to salvage a deal.\\nAustralia\\'s push to reduce trade barriers is receiving support from local meat importers in Europe.\\nThe Australian sheepmeat sector is pushing for an increase to the 19,000 tonne sheepmeat quota in the European Union.\\nOne of the biggest importers of lamb and beef into France, Claude Thieblemont, says if import quotas were lifted, local consumption could double.\\n\"France is very short of production, we supply 40 per cent of all needs and we import 60 per cent of our lamb from abroad,\" he said.\\n\"We would expect to import more from Australia because we like the Australian product. French suppliers [are] buying five kilo per capita per year which is very low and we could multiply this by two or three, easily.\"\\nProfessor Andrew Stoler from the Institute for International Trade says world leaders appear keen to agree to reforms after this week\\'s G8 summit in St Petersburg.\\nHe says that should help to break the deadlock.\\n\"What is going to move the process forward is not the sort of political direction that came out of the recent G8 meetings,\" he said.\\n\"You can\\'t really get any higher level than that unless God comes down and tells them you have to get a deal.\\n\\nAuthority approves canola export licences\\nThe Grains Licensing Authority (GLA) in Western Australia has approved three small export licences for 75,000 tonnes of canola aimed at higher priced markets in Europe and the Middle East.\\nGLA chairman Wayne Obst says higher tonnages were not approved because crop predictions are forecast to be dismal this year.\\nTwo applications to send malting barley to China were knocked back because of the dry conditions in the west.\\nMr Obst says the authority can easily prove the restriction on export licences will benefit growers.\\n\"These canola licences have gone to a higher priced market, that\\'s been caused by the request for canola into the biodiesel market,\" he said.\\n\\nMuch needed rain falls on very dry regions\\nThere is some hope for Western Australia\\'s grain growers today after rain fell overnight in some very dry regions.\\nWhile it is too late for farmers in the large grain growing districts in the northern-mid-west, moderate to good falls further south will boost thirsty crops.\\nWeather bureau forecaster Noel Puzey says the really good news is that a more wintry weather pattern is setting in.\\n\"There have been some reasonable falls to help people along at the moment, falls range from about six millimetres at Dalwallinu in the Central Wheatbelt to 20 millimetres through some parts of the Great Southern and it is still moving through to the east so mainly southern districts can pick up a few showers around the place,\" he said.\\nA group of Victorian farmers are developing a national grading system for biodiesel to assure its quality.\\nWith more and more farmers blending their own fuel, the Central Wimmera Community Enterprise group says the system will quash concerns that biodiesel could damage engines.\\nChairman Peter Neiwand says once an Australian biodiesel standard is in place, the Federal Government will be lobbied to reinstate tax breaks.\\n\\nUS to scale back mad cow disease testing\\nUnited States Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns says his department will scale back its expanded testing for mad cow disease due to its extremely low rates.\\nMr Johanns says years of expanded and normal testing shows the US is likely to have four to seven infected animals and reducing current testing almost ten-fold to 40,000 a year is still well above international guidelines.\\nMr Johanns dismisses concerns the move will cause a new rift with Japan, whose food safety body wants continued high US testing.\\n\"We have bent over backwards with the Japanese, we\\'ve even agreed with them to ship only beef from animals under 20-months and that\\'s a very unique, very, very unusual agreement,\" he said.\\n\\nQld mining sector continues to boom\\nQueensland\\'s mining boom continues to power ahead with the Queensland Government nominating a large parcel of land for future mineral exploration.\\nLabor Member for Mount Isa Tony McGrady says nearly 3,500 square kilometres will be offered under a tender system for prospective mining companies.\\nHe says they will also get data showing deposits of copper, lead, zinc and silver.\\n\"As a result of the work they now have information on mineral prospectivitiy in an area of land bigger than the ACT,\" he said.\\n\\nSAFF seeks help to boost membership\\nSouth Australia\\'s peak farming body wants farmers to help boost membership levels.\\nOnly 65 farmers made the trip to a public workshop in Adelaide today to help redirect the South Australian Farmers Federation (SAFF) into the future.\\nSAFF is asking farmers across the state to come up with ideas to make the organisation more relevant particularly to younger farmers.\\nThe organisation\\'s membership is falling there are currently 4,000 members while there were 11,000 back in the 1980\\'s.\\n\\nGrower challenges importers to buy Aust coffee beans\\nAn organic coffee producer from New South Wales is challenging Australia\\'s three main coffee importers to buy locally grown beans.\\nAustralians drink nearly 50,000 tonnes of coffee a year and almost all of it is imported.\\nOrganic grower Cath Ford says the industry has to demonstrate the quality of local coffee to consumers and coffee suppliers.\\n\"Quite frankly people will buy commodity fair trade coffee over Australian coffee if we can not get across that the quality and flavour is different,\" she said.\\n\"We need to get on our bandwagon and show that what we have is a supreme product over other people\\'s.\"\\n\\nScientists discover bug behind sheep mastitis\\nScientists have discovered sheep mastitis is being caused by a different bug than first thought.\\nThe inflammation of milk glands kills 5 per cent of ewes in Poll Dorset, Suffolk and Texel flocks each year.\\nDr Stuart Barber from the University of Melbourne has found mannheimia is the most common bacteria causing the problem.\\nIt was previously thought staphylococcus brought on the disease, as it does in cows.\\nDr Barber says this new information is crucial.\\n\\nSprouts can curb cancer: DPI\\nNew research has shown eating the sprouts that are often found in mixed salads can help curb cancer.\\nThe Queensland Department of Primary Industries (DPI) has investigated 22 different brassicas, including broccoli and cauliflower.\\nIt has found sprouts can contain up to 200 times more of a chemical which helps dissolve carcinogens, than mature vegetables do.\\nDPI physiologist Tim O\\'Hare says radish and broccoli sprouts rated the highest.\\n\\nProgram aims to get country kids talking about depression\\nA new program tackling depression in country schools is trying to encourage students and teachers to be more open about mental illness.\\nThe beyondblue program comes as new research shows depression and suicide are the two biggest concerns for country kids.\\nAnd while students are most likely to turn to their families and friends for support, it is hoped they will also open up to their teachers.\\nQueensland school counsellor Gary Quinn says students at his school are becoming more willing to talk about depression.\\n\"Most students, once they start doing something to say \\'hey help me\\', they really do want some help,\" he said.\\n\\nFergies flock to flood festival\\nThe heroic feats of the famous grey Ferguson tractor are being celebrated in the New South Wales town of Wentworth this weekend.\\nThe Festival of the Flood will see 300 fergies of all shapes are sizes attending to commemorate massive floods in 1956.\\nThe fergies will be the stars of the show because they were used to build levee banks to stop the rising floodwater and protect the town.\\nFergie enthusiast John Reeves from Geelong will be there and can not wait to catch up with others who share his passion.\\n\\nWebsite to track drought impact\\nThe Federal Government has unveiled its plan to make it easier for farmers to apply for drought relief.\\nThe national agricultural monitoring system is a website which will track how major agricultural regions are performing.\\nWhile state governments could take weeks or months to collate drought information under the old application process, John Sims from the Bureau of Rural Sciences says the new system will take minutes.\\n\"There\\'s information on rainfall, there\\'s information on how that rainfall affects pasture and crop growth, and how that translates into impact on say farm financial performance over the last couple of years,\" he said.\\n\\nCouncils come to farmers\\' aid\\nWith Western Australia in the grip of a dry year, local councils are looking for different ways to help farmers who are struggling to grow a crop this season.\\nThe Shire of Mullewa and the Shire of Chapman Valley will offer road works and community project works to farmers, so they can generate an income.\\nMullewa president Nino Messina says the council has received extra funding for road works and employing farmers makes sense.\\n\"The harvesting will come and farmers won\\'t be able to do anything because they\\'ll have no crop to harvest,\" he said.\\nThe Queensland Nationals are calling on the Federal Government for better measures to protect regional media diversity under its proposed changes to media ownership laws.\\nThe Nationals want the Government to set a mandate for local radio content and legislation to prevent a single company from owning more than two out of three news services in regional centres, including television, radio and newspapers.\\nBut lecturer in media policy and research at the University of Western Sydney Dr Tim Dwyer says the provisions in the Nationals\\' resolution fall well short of any sort of guarantee to provide a diverse range of local news.\\n\\nPigPass to identify food safety risks\\nPork producers have welcomed a new identification system to trace animals from pig pen to plate.\\nPigPass is a national vendor declaration form which must accompany pigs being processed for domestic and export markets.\\nIt is being rolled out now and should be fully in place by January 2007.\\nDavid Miles from the Victorian Farmers Federation\\'s pig group says any disease or food safety risks will be identified with the new pass.\\n\"There\\'s got to be traceback. If we haven\\'t got traceability well we\\'re not going to be able to export or do anything professionally and it will control the industry, as I understand, and the VFF pig group we\\'re quite happy with this,\" he said.\\n\\nLabor backs calls for quarantine system inquiry\\nThe Federal Opposition has joined calls for an independent inquiry into Australia\\'s quarantine system.\\nThe call follows moves from the New South Wales Government and the New South Wales Farmers Association for a Senate inquiry.\\n\\nTop End water region to be mapped\\nThe last major unstudied water region of the Northern Territory\\'s Top End is about to be mapped and modelled.\\nThe Gulf region extends from Mataranka to the Gulf of Carpentaria and has a number of large, permanently running rivers.\\nOver the next three years the Territory Government will uncover not only how the aquifers and rivers interact, but also measure how much water the environment uses.\\nProject officer Ursula Zarr says they need to know how much water there is so they can protect everyone\\'s interests.\\n\\nCommittee chairman rules out renewed push for Hydro privatisation\\nThe chairman of an New South Wales Upper House Committee looking at the future of the Snowy Hydro scheme has rejected reports that it will renew a push for privatisation.\\nThe State Government ruled out trying to sell off its share of the scheme earlier this year, when the Federal and Victorian Governments pulled out of the plan.\\n\\nBanana industry looks at cyclone-proofing\\nThe banana industry is looking at ways to become cyclone-proof to avoid a repeat of this year\\'s shortage.\\nThe Australian Banana Growers Council wants to strengthen smaller growing areas, such as Western Australia\\'s Gascoyne to ensure customer demand can be met.\\nCyclone Larry wiped out most of north Queensland\\'s crop in March, driving up the price of available fruit.\\nSpokesman Tony Heidrich says markets and retailers need to allow smaller growing areas to keep a foothold in the market once Queensland fruit returns.\\n\"You\\'ll never completely cyclone proof the industry,\" he said.\\n\"But what we\\'re saying is we\\'ve obviously got a real problem this time around in having such a big cyclone knock out so much of our production.\\n\\nNo breakthrough in world farm trade talks\\nThere is no sign yet of a breakthrough in last ditch world farm trade talks in Geneva.\\nThe G6, including Australia, Japan, the US and the European Union is meeting in what is considered a final attempt to resolve five years of discussions about trade reform.\\n\\nDairy co-ops increase returns to farmers\\nNew South Wales regional dairy cooperatives have bucked the trend of the major milk processors by increasing returns to farmers this season.\\nNorco and the Bega Cooperative on the north and south coasts have announced step-ups in their milk prices.\\nJanet Moxey from the New South Wales Farmers Association has welcomed the move and believes it could be due to a delay in passing on last year\\'s high returns.\\n\"I don\\'t think New South Wales farmers have actually seen the flow-on of the good times in Victoria last year,\" Ms Moxey said.\\n\"Farmers in New South Wales locked into contracts for a 12-month period and didn\\'t see the step-up payments that were paid out in Victoria.\\n\\nEgg farmer seeks tightening of free-range legislation\\nConsumers are being warned that eggs marked \\'free-range\\' could actually come from caged birds.\\nSome producers claim that some farmers are falsely labelling their eggs and are urging consumers to look out for accreditation from an independent authority like the RSPCA.\\nFree range farmer Tom Fryar has told ABC TV\\'s Landline program that there is no legal definition of the term free-range and legislation should be tightened.\\n\\nBook to focus on mothers and daughters-in-law\\' relationship\\nThe relationships between mothers and their daughters-in-law on family farms is set to go under the microscope in a new book by a South Australian author.\\nAbi Spehr, from Beachport in South Australia, says introducing a new person into an established family business can be traumatic regardless of whether the two women get along.\\nShe says there has been little research done on what can be a difficult relationship and it is time there was.\\n\\nTas vodka wins international awards\\nA Tasmanian distillery which exports vodka to Russia has won two international awards at the Wine and Spirits Fair in London.\\nThe Tamar Distillery, at Beauty Point in northern Tasmania, received bronze medals for its citrus-infused dry gin and Tasmanian pepperberry vodka.\\nManager Phillip Ridyard says Tasmania\\'s pristine water helped the company to crack into the tough Russian market.\\n\"The primary reason is the water and the selection of the water because the crucial part of vodka is low calcium,\" Mr Ridyard said.\\n\"And we produce three blends using three waters, one from the west coast, one from near Scottsdale and a sample from York Town.\\n\"We then held a blind tasting with a group of expatriate Russians.\\n\\nWine glut blamed for price drop\\nWine prices have hit an all-time low, with a major supermarket chains selling bottles of clean skin chardonnay and merlot for $2.00 a bottle.\\nThe move has sent shockwaves through the battling industry, with the wines normally selling for $6.00.\\nThe massive discounting is being blamed on the wine glut and follows a trend set in the US in 2003.\\nChief executive of the Wine Makers Federation of Australia Stephen Strachan says it is a very worrying development.\\n\"I don\\'t think anyone in the industry would\\'ve expected that we get to that point,\" he said.\\n\"What it does is it undermines the strength of existing brands and it means that the temptations for those brands to try and meet similar price points is there because they obviously want to be able to sell their wine.\\n\\nFarmers warned to watch out for food mile phenomenon\\nAustralian farmers have been warned to take note of a new consumer trend in the United Kingdom.\\nCompanies who import Australian beef into Britain and the European Union are wary of the new phrase \\'food miles\\' which could be used to limit imports into that country.\\nFood miles refers to the growing practice of importers and supermarket chains stacking their shelves with exotic items from around the world.\\nThe criticism is they are chewing through too much aircraft and truck fuel in getting them there, thereby increasing carbon emissions.\\nRetail manager from Global, UK\\'s biggest meat importer and also an importer of Australian beef, Bob Rose, says we need to keep an eye on the food mile phenomenon.\\n\"In the UK at the moment, global warming is a very big issue,\" Mr Rose said.\\n\"And one of the issues that has raised its head is bringing product from around the world, and the costs of the carbon emissions to the environment of bringing that product from around the world; would it not bet better sourcing locally-produced product?\\n\\nUranium conference to discuss Labor backflip\\nA bid by Labor leader Kim Beazley to dump his party\\'s opposition to new uranium mines is expected to be a major talking point at the annual Australian Uranium Conference in Perth this week.\\nThree hundred uranium experts, including 30 delegates from China, are at the conference.\\nUranium Information Centre chief executive and conference delegate Ian Hore-Lacey says a major change in political opinion could lead to Australia exporting more uranium.\\nWith current exports going to Korea, Europe and Japan he says the next two big customers will be China and India.\\n\"China is quadrupling its nuclear capacity by 2020 and it\\'s going to need to import most of the uranium to fuel that,\" he said.\\n\"India is another possible country but that\\'s much further out.\\n\\nDraft timber harvesting regulations anger landowners\\nLandowners in New South Wales are angry at the State Government\\'s draft regulations for timber harvesting in privately-owned forests.\\nThe result of years of debate, the code of practice aims to protect rare timber species, and wildlife and biodiversity, on farms.\\nBut it does not include compensation for landowners.\\nRobert Dyason, a tree grower in the state\\'s north, believes the draft code is a missed opportunity.\\n\"We could have been presented with a complete package of code, education and compensation for reserved areas, it would have promoted adaptive management with provision for improvement in management as knowledge improved,\" Mr Dyason said.\\n\\nFire and factory closure leaves 100 jobless\\nAlmost 100 jobs will be lost with the closure of a fibre board factory in Tasmania\\'s north.\\nCarter Holt Harvey has announced it will shut down its Bell Bay plant, which produces the building product MDF.\\nOperations there were suspended a month ago after a multi-million dollar fire.\\nAndrew Eastick from Northern Tasmanian Development says it was a difficult decision.\\n\"The plant has always been marginal and one of the difficulties for the plant is the market for MDF has moved on, it produces a material which is only able to be manufactured down to a certain thickness,\" Mr Eastick said.\\n\"Is the plant able to be re-engineered so that it can produce an MDF material that can attract a premium?\\n\\nFungal disease could wipe out WA wheat crops\\nA disease that can completely wipe out wheat crops appeared for the first time this season in Western Australia.\\nThe fungal disease stripe rust, which can reduce crop yields by up to 90 per cent, has been spotted in the state\\'s south, near Esperance.\\nAgronomist Phil Smyth says farmers are growing wheat varieties with better resistance to the disease but this outbreak could be similar to the epidemic of two years ago.\\n\\nTwo confirmed cases of Q fever in NSW border city\\nVictoria\\'s Department of Human Services has confirmed two cases of Q fever in the border city of Wodonga.\\nA third person is suspected of contracting the disease, which causes heavy flu-like symptoms.\\nPeople working with livestock are usually most at risk of the disease, although the two confirmed patients do not work with livestock.\\nDirector of population health in Albury, Tony Kolbe, says it is unusual, but not impossible, for people who do not work with animals to become ill.\\n\\nAverage rainfall expected right across Australia\\nThe Bureau of Meteorology says most of Australia looks set for average rainfall over the next three months, although the north-east could be drier.\\nThe bureau says there is a 60 to 80 per cent chance of below average rain in the region from Daly Waters in the Northern Territory, south to the corner country and across to Rockhampton in Queensland.\\nElsewhere there is a 50 per cent chance of at least average rainfall between August and October.\\n\\nProducing, manufacturing costs higher than expected\\nThe costs of manufacturing goods and growing produce have risen higher than expected, adding more weight to a forecast interest rate rise next week.\\nTheoretically the big price increases for producing bananas, grains, beef, sheep and dairy products should mean a pay rise for farmers.\\nBut the ANZ bank\\'s chief economist Saul Eslake says the jump in producer prices reflects a lack of supply due to weather conditions, higher fuel prices, and interest rates.\\n\"Drought has constrained grain supplies, the long-term reduction in sheep numbers across Australia has been a factor in rising meat prices, rising beef prices are partly due to the very good prices that Australian producers have been getting overseas and sugar prices have roughly trebled,\" he said.\\n\\nBlack truffles yields \\'fantastic\\'\\nThe black truffle industry is enjoying its best ever season.\\nLow yields have plagued growers in recent years but Tim Terry from Tasmanian Truffle Enterprises says his harvest has tripled this season and it is a similar story around Australia.\\n\"There are certainly some very good yields on the mainland and in Western Australia there have been some fantastic yields of much older plantations of course,\" Mr Terry said.\\n\\nSuspension of trade talks costing farmers\\nThe National Farmers Federation (NFF) says the overnight suspension of world trade talks has cost Australian farmers $1.5 billion in potential new markets.\\nThe G6 group of nations including Australia, Japan, the US and European Union failed to resolve five years of discussions about agricultural trade reform.\\nScott Mitchell from the NFF says the US failed to agree to further subsidy cuts, while Europe would not drop its import barriers.\\n\"All Australian agricultural industries are extremely disappointed at the suspension of the WTO [World Trade Organisation] negotiations overnight,\" Mr Mitchell said.\\n\"This is a huge lost opportunity for Australian farmers to lock in the elimination of export subsidies, to lock in significant cuts in agricultural subsidies being spent around the world and to lock in actual improvements in market access.\"\\nMeanwhile Nationals leader Mark Vaile has played down speculation that he will now hand the trade portfolio over to Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran.\\n\"I think that there\\'s still a lot more that can be done, as we\\'ve got quite a busy agenda on the bi-lateral front with negotiations well under way with China and Malaysia and the ASEAN [South East Asian Nations] countries and I\\'m certainly keen to pursue those,\" Mr Vaile said.\\nUS farmers say they will fight to retain their current level of subsidies, now that the trade talks have stalled.\\nLobby group, the US Farm Bureau, says farmers are not prepared to give ground until Europe offers more concessions.\\nThe group\\'s spokesman, Chris Garza, says internal debate will now begin on the next US farm bill due next year, and farmers will attempt to lock in subsidies.\\n\"What we\\'ve seen is, as these negotiations have gone on countries like the European Union has requested more and more from the United States to give up,\" Mr Garza said.\\n\"We feel as an organisation that there\\'s no reason to give up anything at this point. which means we should not make any changes to our farm bill so that when these negotiations do begin again, we\\'re still where we were before, and we still have something to give up if we have to give something up.\"\\nAmerica\\'s top trade official says the collapse of global trade talks means the US presidential trade deal authority will now likely expire, before any WTO deal can be saved and sent to the US Congress.\\nThere has been a US push to complete a new world trade deal this year leaving enough time for the US Congress to ratify it before the presidential trade deal authority expires next July, when the body could again amend any deal possibly killing it.\\nUS trade ambassador Susan Schwab says the worst will now likely happen.\\n\"We do not expect to be able to use the current TPA [US Trade Promotion Authority] to enact a Doha Round agreement, if and when one comes together,\" Ms Schwab said.\\n\\nRare butterfly found in Arnhem Land\\nA rare and endangered butterfly in north-east Arnhem Land is now a bit safer.\\nThe gove crow butterfly was previously thought to live in only four small patches of rainforest, but now a fifth location has been confirmed.\\nNaturalist Ian Morris says he first saw the butterfly 30 years ago, but was only recently able to confirm it was the gove crow.\\n\"It certainly extends its range by a few hundred kilometres, but probably doesn\\'t stop them being an endangered or threatened species simply because the habitat they live in is so restricted and unique that any disturbance to that could soon cause a crash in their population,\" he said.\\n\\nChurch offers support to stricken farmers\\nFarmers in the driest parts of Western Australia are hoping for some divine intervention this week.\\nAnglican Archbishop of Perth Roger Herft and regional Bishop Tom Wilmot are touring the mid-west and wheat belt, to meet with farmers and offer support.\\nBishop Wilmot says the turnout has been huge so far.\\n\"One farmer said that it\\'s a bit like grief or having a death in the family, but there\\'s no burial, because every day you stand on the porch and you look out at the body, as it were,\" he said.\\n\"I can sympathise with that because these people identify very closely with the land. There is a level of grief there, but as with all grief, it draws families together.\\n\\nDrought officers angry over job loss\\nCommunity drought officers in Victoria\\'s Wimmera region are at a loss to explain why their jobs have been cut.\\nThree of the four positions are no longer being funded by the Victorian Government, even though the drought is lingering across the region.\\nFormer community drought officer in Yarriambiac Shire, Faye Smith says they met with the Department of Human Services and the State Drought Committee in Horsham yesterday but still do not know if they have a job.\\n\"I was totally amazed,\" she said.\\n\"To me it just seemed the strangest decision and now more than ever the community strengthening is needed.\\n\"I cannot understand why the State Government would make the decision to wipe out the position when, as most people will tell you, that the situation now is probably as dire as it\\'s ever been.\"\\n\\nSA loses rural counsellors\\nThe number of rural financial counsellors in South Australia will be scaled back, following changes to the way the service is provided.\\nThe Federal Government spent two years reviewing the program and opened up tenders for a single, state-based provider in April.\\nThe service will now be run by the newly formed Rural Financial Counselling South Australia.\\nSpokesman John Voumard says it will allow counsellors to be allocated to areas of need.\\n\"There are periods of demand and they occur at different times in different areas,\" he said.\\n\\nUranium shortage forces commodity price up\\nAs Australia debates the merits of opening up new uranium mines, analysts say a global shortage of the commodity is pushing up prices.\\nThe spot price for uranium has jumped $US2 in the past week to $US47.25 per pound.\\nANZ Bank commodity analyst Andrew Harrington says half of the world\\'s nuclear power is currently sourced from recycled nuclear weapons left over from the Cold War.\\nHe says Australia\\'s massive reserves of uranium are in high demand for nuclear powered plants, because recycled uranium is running out.\\n\"Mostly it was to do with the renewed interest in uranium as a commodity, because the recycled uranium from nuclear weapons is starting to decline, so the primary source of uranium coming from mines needs to make up for that shortfall,\" he said.\\n\\nQuarantine boost following marine pest find\\nThe increased threat of an exotic marine pest has prompted Northern Territory authorities to strengthen offshore quarantine measures.\\nThe black-striped mussel has been found twice in the past week on seized illegal fishing vessels inside Darwin Harbour.\\nThe pest was found after the boats were moored.\\nTerritory Fisheries spokesman Peter Zeroni says quarantine checks will now be done five nautical miles offshore.\\n\"As a result of events that occurred last week, we have made a decision as an interim measure to now inspect all vessels out at the five nautical mile buoy in open water, where the risk is less,\" he said.\\n\"The risk at 1.5 is low due to it being an open-water environment ... however, as a precautionary measure we have moved the boats now further out.\\n\"From an NT Fisheries perspective, the risk is manageable where they are. We are concerned about the NT\\'s internal waters, waters within three nautical miles and probably out to 10.\\n\"We have a strong interest in ensuring those waters are free of aquatic pests.\"\\n\\nGrain prices rise as US turns to ethanol\\nThe rising cost of fuel in America is having a positive impact on Australian wheat prices, according to an agriculture publication.\\nMore consumers in the US are turning to corn-based ethanol, increasing corn consumption by 15 per cent to 60 million tonnes and boosting prices by up to 20 per cent.\\nRichard Koch from Profarmer says the US corn price sets the basis for the global feed grain market, which will have spin offs for Australian wheat and canola growers.\\n\"I\\'ve seen some analysis that indicates the value of soft commodities in the medium-term could increase six-fold,\" he said.\\n\\nAWB legal battle back before court\\nThe legal battle over the future of the oil-for-food inquiry is back in the Federal Court today.\\nThis time a challenge has been initiated by Commissioner Terence Cole, who does not want to participate in the case about AWB\\'s claim to withhold documents from his inquiry.\\nThe Commissioner\\'s lawyers are asking the court to determine the legitimacy of AWB\\'s claim of legal professional privilege over 1,300 documents.\\n\\nFarmers seek better food label laws for online shopping\\nFarmers say an oversight by Australia\\'s peak food regulator is allowing fruit and vegetables to be sold on the Internet without new country-of-origin labelling.\\nFood Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) introduced the tougher labelling laws last month after farmers fought for imported food to be clearly identified.\\nHowever, with major supermarkets now offering online grocery sales, the rules do not apply.\\nBrian Bond from the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association says FSANZ should have identified the issue.\\n\"It\\'s obviously been an oversight by Food Standards Australia and New Zealand and it\\'s something that certainly needs to be looked at and if we can plug the gap we should,\" he said.\\n\"We need sales and I guess this area of sales is going to increase rather than decrease so it\\'s certainly something that needs addressing.\"\\nLydia Buchtmunn from FSANZ says the issue has not been overlooked.\\n\"Actually we\\'ve been addressing that for quite a long time we\\'ve been looking at the whole labelling standard to look at things perhaps that are home delivered,\" she said.\\n\\nUS producers weary of resumption in Japan trading\\nCattle producers in the United States are not hopeful of a quick resumption of their beef trade to Japan, despite a successful tour of US meat plants by Japanese inspectors.\\nThe beef trade is awaiting confirmation that US beef will again be allowed into Japan after a two-year bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-related ban.\\nThe ban was lifted late last year but reimposed after early shipments were found to contain traces of spinal cord.\\nJay Truitt, from the National Cattlemens Beef Association, thinks many producers and processors might not want to supply Japan again.\\n\"I think there\\'s some excitement, obviously, it\\'s tempered, because history has been a good teacher for us, that we shouldn\\'t get too excited,\" he said.\\n\"More importantly though, from our perspective, is that we really look at our industry and we begin to now look sincerely at what are the opportunities for us in Japan and they\\'re still quite limited and we\\'re not going to over prepare for it, it\\'s an expensive market for us to function.\\n\\nNo growth predicted for south-west WA pastures\\nThe CSIRO says pasture growth rates in Western Australia\\'s south-west are shaping up to be the worst in nearly 100 years.\\nNew satellite data shows growth rates are expected to be down 60 per cent on last year, due to abnormal weather patterns.\\nThe CSIRO\\'s Dr Steve Gherhardi says, as a result, many farmers have reduced stock numbers to give paddocks a spell.\\n\"Even now, if farmers have had a break, they\\'d need to make decisions on how long they would want to defer that pasture to ensure that they\\'ll get some growth occurring,\" he said.\\n\\nDrought, costs force farmers to cut water usage\\nThe number of irrigated Australian farms has dropped a further 13 per cent, according to a new report by the bureau of statistics.\\nIn the year 2004-05, just over 35,000 Australian farms used irrigation, down 5,000 on the year before.\\nThe report shows less water is being used to grow pasture and rice, although more is going into growing cotton.\\nDoug Miell from the New South Wales Irrigators Council says the fall is partly due to drought, but also because of high water prices.\\nHe says many irrigators are focusing on crops, which give them a higher return, or selling their water.\\n\"There\\'s obviously a consolidation happening right across agriculture in the irrigation sector, there\\'s no difference in that regard,\" he said.\\n\\nWool companies look at partial integration\\nThe boards of Australia\\'s two peak wool companies are still talking up the industry\\'s future despite now having to look at ways of joining forces without a full merger.\\nPlans to unit Australian Wool Services (AWS) with Australian Wool Innovation are on hold while the Federal Government decides whether to help AWS pay off a $27 million overseas debt.\\nChairman Barry Walker is hopeful the Government will come to the rescue, but says the two companies are looking at how to integrate parts of their organisations anyway.\\n\"There are certainly major savings in running a single company,\" he said.\\n\\nPublic interest tests urged before hospital closures\\nThe Australian Medical Association (AMA) wants all state governments to introduce public interest tests before downgrading or closing any more public hospitals in rural areas.\\nThe doctors\\' lobby group says after years of neglect, governments should do whatever it takes to keep country public hospitals open and properly staffed.\\nAMA rural reference group chairman Dr David Rivett says the test should examine how closures affect the health needs of residents, local employment and the availability of other health services.\\n\"We want to see the impact on the maintenance of skills of the medical workforce factored in, the impact on the health needs of the local communities and that includes the social dislocation they have when they have to travel many miles to seek treatment,\" he said.\\n\"We want to see the impact of employment on the community when people have to travel with sick children to the cities and give up their jobs for days or weeks, and we want to see the availability of alternative resources all factored into the equation.\"\\n\\nUS lamb market set to slow down\\nThere is a warning for lamb producers today that growth in the US market is set to slow down over the next year.\\nSales of our lamb to the US grew by 28 per cent between 2004 and 2005 to become Australia\\'s highest value market worth $327 million.\\nBut Shane O\\'Hara from the Australian Lamb Company says exports are under pressure from similar factors to here, like competition from cheaper meats like chicken.\\n\"We\\'ve seen some higher fuel costs, that\\'s having a big pinch on disposable income,\" he said.\\n\\nUS blames Europe for collapse of trade talks\\nThe blame game has started following the collapse of the Doha world trade talks.\\nKey nations have failed to agree on how to cut farm and industrial tariffs, and US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns is blaming Europe\\'s refusal to let more beef in.\\nBut Andrew McCallum from Meat and Livestock Australia says the trade talks did not detail individual agricultural products.\\n\"I think what Johanns has done has just highlighted the beef issue as an example,\" he said.\\n\\nFruit wholesaler says banana returns increasing\\nA leading Queensland fruit wholesaler says he is surprised that bananas are being blamed for a higher than expected rise in inflation.\\nEconomists blame skyrocketing banana prices, as well as fuel costs, for the 1.6 per cent jump in the June quarter Consumer Price Index.\\nMore than 90 per cent of the Australian banana crop was wiped out earlier this year when cyclone Larry hit far north Queensland.\\nPeter Kedwell from the Brisbane Markets says while volume is down, returns are actually up.\\n\"Bananas [on] average used to be around $15 to $20 a box, now it\\'s $150 a box,\" he said.\\n\\nLivestock transporter wants more rationalisation\\nThere are calls today for more rationalisation and enforcement of legislation in the livestock transport sector.\\nJim Cooper is the departing owner of the nation\\'s largest livestock trucking fleet, Road Trains of Australia.\\nHe has just sold his livestock fleet to another operator and believes it was a necessary step.\\nMr Cooper will keep his other transport business and concentrate on the growing resources sector.\\n\"The way the mining sector\\'s regulated ... yes we can work within the legislation and compliance within the mining industry,\" he said.\\n\"I certainly see some of the services for the remote area cattle haulage pulling back. I think a lot of the road trains, whether they are RTA or Hampton\\'s, operate very much like a taxi rank.\\n\\nTrip may have cleared up river diversion concerns\\nLocal Aboriginal people may now be more open to the idea of expanding a Northern Territory lead and zinc mine.\\nXstrata is currently seeking environmental approvals to move the McArthur River five and a half kilometres, so its mine can become an open-cut operation.\\nThe company recently took a group of traditional owners to a coal mine in Victoria to see first hand what river diversion involves.\\nJohn Moriarty, the chairman of the Borroloola Community Reference Group, thinks the trip might have cleared up some concerns.\\n\\nFarmer hopes assistance package will keep town afloat\\nThe Western Australian Government has announced an assistance package for farmers in some of the State\\'s most severely drought-affected regions.\\nFarmer Glenn Thomas was one of 150 locals at a dry season crisis meeting in the wheatbelt town of Mullewa yesterday.\\nAlthough details of the package are not yet known, Mr Thomas hopes it will help to keep his community afloat through the worst farming year he has ever known.\\n\"There\\'s different situations throughout the shires. There\\'s many in the outlying areas that have really only had one good season in the last five or six and, really, that\\'s just not enough to get back on your feet,\" he said.\\n\\nMental health concerns switch to young people in rural areas\\nThe National Mental Health Initiative has raised concerns about the lack of information available about how the drought has affected young people in rural Australia.\\nCraig Hodges from beyondblue says the last survey was carried out in the late 1990s and data is up to 10-years-old.\\nHe says the spin-offs from the drought are significant, with about a quarter of young people affected by depression, anxiety and other mental health issues.\\n\"We only get this data every five to 10 years and the last one that was taken was in the late 90s which showed there was roughly one in four young women experiencing depression and one in six young men experienced depression,\" he said.\\n\"They see what is happening with their parents, how parents respond to tough times on the farm and that also may mean there\\'s less disposable income so that might mean they can\\'t do the things they once did, so the spin-offs are quite significant.\"\\nThe drought is also affecting young peoples choices at school.\\nAt Redbank Catholic College in the west of central New South Wales, 68 students from across the state are studying agriculture in their final years.\\nJust a few say they will go onto work in the sector.\\n\\nAWB announces restructure\\nWheat exporter AWB has announced a further restructure to improve transparency but says it is not a result of the oil-for-food scandal.\\nUnder the plan AWB International, which holds the licence for the single desk for exports, will be further separated from the company\\'s corporate division.\\nIt will have an independent board and management team, and its own governance and committee structure.\\nAWB chairman Brendan Stewart says the change is a result of feedback from grower groups and growers and is not a knee-jerk reaction to the Cole inquiry.\\n\"These changes that we are making have absolutely nothing to do with the Cole inquiry, these are changes that we have initiated 18 months ago,\" he said.\\n\"They have been a long time coming, they have been a process of detailed analysis and impact so that we delivered on the key promise that we gave to growers.\"\\nMr Stewart rejects any suggestions from grower groups that it is too little too late.\\n\"I don\\' think that\\'s the case at all,\" he said.\\nGrains analyst Malcolm Bartholomaeus says there are major flaws in the restructure because the wheat sales division will not be part of AWB International and still will not be accountable enough.\\n\"One of the implications is that the situation we\\'ve seen with the Iraq inquiry and the scandal there, and potentially the allegations of other payments being made in other market places, basically that could still happen again and put the single desk at risk with no control over the situation by AWB,\" he said.\\nAWB has rejected the suggestions.\\nMeanwhile AWB has cut its estimated before-tax profit by between 20 to 25 per cent.\\nThe company says the drought has led to lower merchandise and fertiliser sales, and results have also been affected by difficult ongoing trading conditions and volatile world markets.\\nProfits for the year ending September 30 are expected to drop from a forecast $184.5 million to around $140 million.\\n\\nWool companies sign merger MOU\\nAustralia\\'s two peak wool companies will press on with a merger, despite an outstanding $27 million debt.\\nAustralian Wool Innovation (AWI) and Australian Wool Services (AWS) have been in long-running talks about a merger, but the stumbling block has been AWS\\'s outstanding debt to a UK-based superannuation fund.\\nThe two companies have now signed a memorandum of understanding to look at the legal and financial implications of integration with work to start immediately.\\nThe Federal Government had been approached to help pay off the debt, but the companies now say they will work together to solve the issue.\\n\\nProducers told not to panic over Japanese beef decision\\nJapan has lifted its ban on US beef but the experts say Australian producers do not need to panic just yet.\\nJapan will only accept US beef under 20 months of age and from a limited number of accredited meat plants.\\nMeat and Livestock Australia says Australian exports to Japan should remain steady at around 390,000 tonnes a year.\\nMalcolm Foster from the Australian Lotfeeders Association does not think the US will pose any short-term threat and says other markets are available anyway.\\n\"The alternate markets to Japan are obviously other Asian markets, in particular Korea, Taiwan and those markets, although markets in the Middle East and even markets in Russia are starting to open up now for Australian exporters,\" he said.\\n\"So there are other markets but Japan will always be a very important one for us.\"\\nUS cattlemen are upset over the tough restrictions imposed by Tokyo.\\nThe National Cattlemen\\'s Beef Association argues Japan\\'s partial reopening is just a first step toward full resumption of trade worth $US1.4 billion, before America lost the market to Australia following a 2003 mad cow case.\\nThe association\\'s Jay Truitt says Tokyo\\'s limits on US cattle age and number of plants that can ship is far too restrictive.\\n\"Everyone of these restrictions adds cost to the system - that\\'s not what we want,\" he said.\\n\\nFood prices hit 15-year high\\nAustralia has posted its biggest increase in food prices in 15 years.\\nRabobank says the figures, which are being blamed for a big jump in inflation, show an 8.3 per cent rise in food costs.\\nBut head of food and agribusiness research Bill Cordingley says the rise was mainly driven by soaring banana prices, with fruit prices up a stunning 52 per cent for the June quarter.\\nPrices rose for citrus fruit, apples, melons and strawberries, due to consumer demand for an alternative to bananas.\\n\\nAWB restructure not enough, says US lobby group\\nAmerica\\'s peak grains lobby group claims a major restructure announced by wheat exporter AWB is just for show.\\nAWB has announced a multi-million dollar plan to separate its export arm AWB International from its corporate division.\\nAs part of a push for better corporate governance, AWB International will continue to manage the single desk for wheat exports, but have its own management team and board.\\nRebecca Coleman from US Wheat Associates says it still wants the AWB\\'s monopoly on exports removed.\\n\"US wheat does not think that it is going to make a difference, we think that it\\'s just another show game and a shifting of boxes,\" she said.\\n\"US Wheat\\'s concerns has always been the power of the monopoly board, the way that they function in distorting trade and so a shifting of boxes around doesn\\'t change the monopoly structure.\"\\nAustralia\\'s peak body, the Grains Council, will not comment on AWB\\'s restructure plan.\\nIn the wake of yesterday\\'s announcement, AWB shares fell by 33 cents but recovered to finish at $3.85, just five cents below the opening price.\\nThere has been little movement on the company\\'s share price today, and Austock Agribusiness analyst Paul Jensz says the market has reacted positively.\\n\"With this restructuring I think investors probably look at it as a first small step of a long road of recovery,\" he said.\\n\"Investors broadly are saying that this level around $3.50-$3.90 is the bottom of AWB at this point.\" \\n\\nCrop forecasts\\nWinter crop forecasts in the eastern states have had a remarkable turnaround due to recent widespread rain.\\nGrain handler, Graincorp, says early prospects for this season were dismal, but after late breaks in June and July, it is expecting receivals of around 9 million tonnes.\\nManaging director Tom Keene says that is on par with the past two seasons.\\n\"Victoria around 3 million tonnes and around 5 million tonnes in New South Wales, Queensland we would expect to get around 1 million tonnes,\" he said.\\n\\nBiofuels Institute to be based in SA\\nAlternative feedstocks to supply the growing alternative fuels industry will be the focus of a new federally-funded Australian Biofuels Institute.\\n\\nAd campaign to highlight abuse of migrant visa program\\nThe union movement has launched a campaign to highlight misuse of the skilled migrant visa program.\\nUnder the 457 program, employers like abattoirs can import skilled workers when they can not be found locally.\\nUnions have now launched a $300,000 ad campaign highlighting abuses of the scheme and Graeme Bird from the Meat Industry Employees Union says they want action.\\n\\nGovt urged to stop river environmental flows\\nWater shortages in western Victoria are now so severe that farmers are asking the State Government to halt environmental flows into rivers.\\nWith reservoirs only 7 per cent full, farmers are facing the prospect of no available water to fill house dams and paying to cart the water they need for livestock and crop spraying.\\nPresident of the Victorian Farmers Federation Simon Ramsay says if there is not enough rain in August, water for rivers should be re-allocated to farms and homes.\\n\"The 2,859 megalitres that sits under the bulk entitlement for environmental flows would be better used and have a greater impact to provide water for stock and domestic use, if needed, rather than the sort of nil effect it will have flushing down the Wimmera River,\" he said.\\nMeanwhile Australia needs five years of average rainfall to rebuild water levels in irrigation storages.\\nThat is the view of Professor Wayne Meyer, chief scientist at the Co-operative Research Centre for Irrigation Futures.\\nIrrigators have not had full water allocations since 2001 and Professor Meyer says ongoing low rainfall has reduced the amount of water available by a third.\\n\"If you look at the storage situation it will take several years of even average rainfall to get our storages back up to those, for example, that we had at the end of the 90s, early part of 2000,\" he said.\\n\\nMcGauran joins push to lift ban on GM crops\\nThere is growing pressure on the states to lift their bans on commercial trials of genetically modified (GM) crops.\\nState governments have powers over land which they have used to impose the bans.\\nNow federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has joined farm groups in calling for the moratoria to be lifted, saying there are environmental and economic benefits from the technology.\\n\"I believe the states\\' opposition to genetically modified crops is purely philosophical or ideological, it makes no economic or environmental sense,\" he said.\\n\"Farmers should make the decision for themselves based on their reading of the marketplace.\\n\\nNew patrol boat to join illegal fishing fight\\nA new Navy patrol boat designed to monitor Australia\\'s northern waters for illegal fishing will be commissioned at Port Pirie in South Australia tomorrow.\\nThe Armidale class ship, to be called HMAS Pirie, is the latest in a new fleet of ships dedicated to border security operations.\\nLieutenant Commander Kimbal Dunsmore, commanding officer of the new vessel, says the Navy is now much better equipped to intercept and board illegal fishing boats.\\n\"These ships have cutting edge technology. They are a very, very complex machine that offer better endurance, better habitability, longer time on task and a better capability,\" he said.\\n\\nAbattoir fish project likely to expand\\nThe first attempt at growing fish in waste water from abattoirs has been successfully carried out in South Australia.\\nThe lamb exporter, Tatiara Meat Company, uses about 1 million litres of water a day in its operations.\\nMost of it is recycled, but waste water held in storage ponds is now being used to grow goldfish, barramundi and carp, purifying the water so it can be used to grow fodder for livestock.\\nEnvironmental officer Fil Farina says the project is likely to expand.\\n\\nQld police investigate crop sabotage\\nNorth Queensland police are investigating the sabotage of crops in the horticulture district of Bowen.\\nCrops have been deliberately poisoned on four farms, causing a million dollars\\' damage to paddocks of watermelons, beans, tomatoes and capsicums.\\nBowen company Queensland Seedlings lost thousands of plants in a similar attack in 2002, and no one has ever been charged.\\nSpokesman Andrew Paterson supplies seedlings to some of the affected farmers and says the damage has created a lot of fear and uncertainty.\\n\"Basically someone out there, or persons, or person, I don\\'t know, is holding us all to ransom,\" he said.\\n\\nPM visits cyclone Larry affected communities\\nPrime Minister John Howard is in north Queensland today to meet victims of cyclone Larry, visiting communities between Innisfail and Tully.\\nBanana growers who had their crops wiped out will ask the PM to extend labour support schemes.\\n\\nUS drought hits sheep flock\\nThe drought in the United States has not just hit the grain crop.\\nThe latest US Department of Agriculture figures have shown the nation\\'s sheep flock has fallen by 30,000 to 7.7 million head, denting hopes that numbers were rebuilding.\\nMeat and Livestock Australia says that is likely to increase US reliance on imports from countries like Australia for a number of years.\\n\\nQld shearer wins Diamond Shears comp\\nA shearer from southern inland Queensland has won the the Diamond Shears competition, run for the first time in five years at Longreach over the weekend.\\nOnce regarded as the most prestigious shearing event in the southern hemisphere, organisers have battled insurance problems but managed to attract shearers from three states and New Zealand for this year\\'s event.\\nWinner Laurie Bateman says he hopes it will help entice more young people into the wool industry.\\n\"I think if we can keep these sport shearing competitions going, we may be able to entice a few more rural people out of the towns to come into our industry,\" he said.\\n\"I can see it being the best show in Australia down the track. Anybody can shear a sheep or come into a shearing shed, wool handle, press, class, if you are fit and keen enough to get out there and earn a bit of money.\"\\n\\nMeat industry agreement to tackle skilled visa abuse\\nThe Australian Meat Industry Council is trying to stamp out abuse of the program to import skilled migrants to fill labour shortages.\\nUnions claim some employers are breaching the rules by underpaying workers, using skilled workers to perform unskilled jobs and not providing proper training.\\nThe Immigration Department has frozen visa applications until the concerns are addressed.\\nChief executive Kevin Cottrell says a labour agreement is being negotiated to ensure all sectors stay within the law.\\n\\nGrains Council awaits AWB restructure details\\nFour days after news of a major restructure at wheat exporter AWB, the nation\\'s peak grains body says it still needs more detail before it can comment.\\nAWB has announced the separation of its export and corporate arms, to improve transparency.\\nThe Grains Council says it will continue to support the current system, and will not endorse any restructure proposals until the \"oil for food\" inquiry is over.\\nChairman Murray Jones has rejected suggestions the council is responding too slowly.\\n\"All AWB has given us is the press release and so we really haven\\'t got any further detail,\" he said.\\n\"They\\'ve spoken themselves about giving further detail over the period of time.\\n\\nQld unveils $1bn Toowoomba-Gladstone rail link\\nThe Queensland Government has committed a billion dollars to complete a railway link between Toowoomba and the expanding central port of Gladstone.\\nPremier Peter Beattie says the 200 kilometres of rail will solve a \"missing link\" in the state\\'s rail system.\\nIt will mainly be used to transport billions of tonnes of coal from the Stuart Basin to port, but Everald Compton from the Australian Inland Expressway Project says grain growers will also benefit.\\n\"Twenty million tonnes of coal a year will go out on the line but in addition it will mean that all the grain crops, the cotton and beef and all types of products can also use the port of Gladstone, which they are unable to do now,\" he said.\\n\\nWool growers seek speedy industry body merger\\nA rebel group of wool growers says a proposed merger between the industry\\'s two peak bodies must be completed before producers are asked to vote to increase levies later this year.\\nLate last week, Australian Wool Innovation and Australian Wool Services signed a deal to look at the legal and financial implications of integration.\\nMartin Oppenheimer from the Australian Wool Growers Association has welcomed the move, and says it needs to happen quickly.\\n\"The issue that we have now, moving forward, we\\'ve got Woolpoll 2006 coming up this December that will decide how much wool tax that wool growers will be spending for the next three years,\" he said.\\n\"We need to know what the strategic plan is of the new merged entity.\\n\"We can\\'t be voting on a level of wool tax for the next three years if we don\\'t know what the company will look like or what its goals will be.\"\\nIn New South Wales, growers from the Goulburn-Yass branch of the Superfine Wool Growers Association voted unanimously to support the agreement at a meeting on Friday night.\\nChairman John Ive says the merger talks have been dragging on for too long.\\n\"With this sort of stand-off position between the two bodies, it wasn\\'t giving good vibes to wool growers,\" he said.\\n\\nIrrigators push for bore water sales to Toowoomba\\nIrrigators on Queensland\\'s Darling Downs say they will push ahead with a plan to sell water to the Toowoomba City Council, after residents overwhelmingly voted against using recycled water.\\nAt a referendum on Saturday, 62 per cent of Toowoomba residents said they were not prepared to use treated waste water to alleviate shortages.\\nJohn McVeigh, from lobby group NuWater, says irrigators can sell 5,000 megalitres of bore water to the city each year.\\n\"Irrigators in our part of the world have put on the table a concept of urban rural water trade, now that\\'s a concept that is getting support from CSIRO and is certainly something that has been practised in Israel and California,\" he said.\\n\\nShellfish disease spreads off Vic coast\\nAbalone divers and fisheries officers have been unable to stop the spread of a herpes-like disease, which is killing shellfish off the coast of south-west Victoria.\\nA 10 kilometre no diving and fishing zone was implemented off Port Fairy last month, but ganglioneuritis is now killing abalone a kilometre outside the boundary.\\nMark Gervis, from South Ocean Mariculture, says as well as affecting wild stocks, the disease has hit on-shore abalone fish farms hard.\\n\\nOnline grain exchange nears launch\\nA consortium of agriculture and finance industry experts says it is almost ready to launch an Internet trading system for grain, oil seeds and legumes.\\nWheat is the only commodity to be restricted to trade only in Australia.\\nCon Galtos from the Australian Grain Exchange is in negotiations with the major grain handling companies to talk up the benefits.\\nHe says the system will give growers access to every price being offered in the

level playing field,\" he said.\\n\\nWheat belt communities tackle achohol-related deaths\\nCommunities in WA\\'s wheat belt are trying to halt the growing number of alcohol-related deaths in the region.\\nThe Wheatbelt Public Health Unit will work with the police to make drinking venues safer by training bar staff to stop serving customers when they have had enough.\\nSpokeswoman Julia Dick says most people would be shocked at just how many people are killed by alcohol each year.\\n\"Probably about 15 deaths a year in the wheat belt are attributable to alcohol.

money.\\n\\nTax review hits agribusiness shares\\nNervous investors have wiped up to 25 per cent off the value of a number of companies involved in agribusiness managed investment schemes.\\nCompanies including Great Southern, Timbercorp and Wilmott Forests have been hit in recent weeks.\\nInvestment analyst Steve Johnson says some of the uncertainty is being caused by a federal review of the tax incentives offered for the schemes, which include timber, grapes, almonds and olives.\\n\"Most other businesses certainly aren\\'t as volatile as this, it would be a 25 per cent fall, I would say, in the last 3 weeks,\" he said.\\n\\nUS blamed for trade talks impasse\\nUS President George W Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair say they will make a final effort to save stalled global trade talks after a weekend meeting at the White House.\\nThe Doha talks are at standstill after major trading powers failed to reach agreement on reforms to international farm trade.\\nThe European

most of the nation\\'s significant ports need upgrades worth around $80 million each.\\nNationals Member for Hinkler in Queensland Paul Neville says money will need to be spent to protect Australian exports of minerals, grain, timber and mineral sands.\\nHe says transport networks in general are having trouble keeping up with the needs of the export sector.\\n\"We have found that at nearly every port there is a need for some sort of improvement to the connectivity between the main road and rail freight truck routes and the ports themselves,\" he said.\\n\"Now it varies from port to port and at one it might be a new rail connection, in another one it might be a ring road around the port and another the widening of the channels into the ports.\\n\"We feel they could probably do it a bit better.\"\\n\\nPM\\'s news an \\'enormous relief\\' in rural Aust\\nThere has been a largely warm response to Prime Minister John Howard\\'s decision to stay on and fight the next federal

is urging others not to use the collapse as an excuse to destabilise the wool industry.\\n\\nHerbicide used to poison crops, police say\\nPolice in north Queensland have confirmed that the common herbicide glyphosate was used to poison up to 40 hectares of fruit and vegetable crops near Bowen.\\nA special Queensland Government task force has been set up in the region, to find out how the poison, which is commonly known as Roundup, got into the system in the first place.\\nOne million dollars damage has been caused to the crops and police now suspect a water source associated with crop

under the new Australian animal welfare strategy.\\nThe strategy, to be finalised by the end of the year, will emphasise the need for ongoing training and accreditation in pest control, whether it be for wild dogs or cane toads.\\nBut Tony English from the Wild Animal Working Group says the widely used toxin 1080 is not under threat at this stage.\\n\"Not in the short term - 1080 at the moment is still too valuable a toxin for us for use in say wild dogs and foxes, that there\\'s no suggestion at all that we would be looking to phase out 1080,\" he said.\\n\"We can start to look for new toxins and that\\'s happening but there is some research being done to incorporate analgesic drugs, pain killing drugs with the 1080 to make it perhaps more humane than it currently is.\\n\\nGoats theft to hurt students\\nThe head of an agricultural college in western Queensland says the theft of up to 300 boer goats will have a major impact on breeding and teaching programs.\\nTen pure bred bucks, 90 does and up to 200 kids valued at $13,000 were stolen from the property, Manningham, near Longreach.\\nPeter Scott from the Australian Agricultural College Corporation says the theft will hurt students.\\n\"Thirteen thousand dollars is a significant commercial loss for us because all our pastoral operations must support themselves, but you know 90 does out of our breeding herd that\\'s a significant loss,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re probably trying to develop a really good commercial meat goat flock so that we\\'ve got a good model for teaching and demonstration purposes.\"\\n\\nNew food labelling laws cover Internet shopping: FSANZ\\nFood Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) says Internet grocery sales are covered by new country of origin labelling laws.\\nHorticulturists had

litre step up for spring.\\nBut Tony Pratico from the WA Farmers Federation says prices need to be substantially raised now.\\n\"I think the processors have to start reviewing it now because the milk\\'s price has to move forward or else on one of the processors here in Western Australia will find themselves without milk,\" he said.\\n\\nWimmera economy hard hit by drought\\nThe lingering effects of the drought and ongoing tough seasonal conditions in Victoria\\'s grain growing Wimmera region are still hitting the region\\'s economy.\\nThe Wimmera Development Association says

many rural towns.\\n\\nOne in 12 year event behind weather pattern, says forecaster\\nA one in 12 year weather event is creating an unusually wet winter in the north of Australia but dry conditions in the south, according to a Queensland forecaster.\\nDr Roger Stone says the sub-tropical ridge has dropped below the Australian continent to the south of Tasmania this year.\\nHe says it is an important cyclical event which might explain this winter\\'s conditions.\\n\"It\\'s the second most important factor after the El Nino SOI system,\" he said.\\n\"As people may have noticed it\\'s been way south, it gives us a lot of easterlies or south easterlies on to the Queensland coast , but also tends to bring in a bit more moisture than might normally be the case.\\n\"It tends to get a bit too wet up around Cairns in this type of year, but it can help the situation in central Queensland.\\n\\nAWB lowers estimated pool returns\\nWheat exporter AWB has lowered its estimated pool returns

borrowings may feel the pinch.\\nHe also says a dollar at 76 cents US does not help export income.\\nMr Dobbin says the main cost concerns farmers have are rising fuel and fertiliser bills.\\n\"I think the rural sector can cope with this rise,\" he said.\\n\"Seasonal conditions at this stage are generally pretty good, a lot of the commodity prices are in sound position.\\n\\nTrade policy expert talks up possibility of Japan FTA\\nAn expert on trade policy says the prospects for a lucrative free trade agreement (FTA) between Australia and Japan have never been better.\\nForeign Minister Alexander Downer discussed a possible FTA with the Japanese Prime Minister in Tokyo yesterday and both countries are completing a feasibility study.\\nDr Ann Capling from Melbourne University is studying the potential benefits of such an agreement, which was flatly rejected by the Japanese Government in 2002.\\nJapan is already Australia\\'s most important trading partner, but quotas and high tariffs continue to restrict exports of beef, dairy, pork, grains, oilseeds, and fruit, and vegetables.\\nDr Capling says there is increasing pressure on Japan to allow more of these supplies in.\\n\\nUS confident of maintaining Iraq wheat market\\nIraq is now America\\'s fourth largest wheat customer and the United States sees continued strong purchases in a market once firmly in Australia\\'s court.\\nAgriculture Secretary Mike Johanns was in Baghdad for farm co-operation meetings with Iraqi officials this week.\\nAnd despite an expected strong Iraqi wheat harvest this year,

Board of Trade has closed, representing a new era for the world\\'s largest commodity trader.\\nThe Board of Trade website says the introduction of electronic trading of agricultural futures contracts

sites open for a year in Victoria and three in central Queensland.\\nIt is not yet known what other sites across New South Wales will remain open and how much the move will cost the company.\\nGraincorp is expected to release further details tomorrow.\\nIn Victoria, the Wimmera has been the most persuasive, saving four of eight sites earmarked for closure.\\nRon Jackson, from Patchewollock in the Mallee region, says it is only a 12 month reprieve.\\n\\nFox find may prove costly\\nThere is irrefutable proof that foxes are alive and thriving in Tasmania after the discovery of a still warm carcass by a farmer in the Northern Midlands yesterday.\\nIt is believed the animal had recently been hit by a car.\\nTasmania has been considered fox free and the pest could cost the state economy $8 million a year if it gets a foothold.\\nWildlife biologist Nick Mooney says the fox, a young adult male, was likely to have been born in Tasmania.\\nHe says it is the evidence that will finally silence the sceptics.\\n\"We\\'ve had proof for years we believe,\" he said.\\n\"This is just a most unfortunate and other piece of evidence, so I would have loved to have not seen anything ever again.\\n\\nNursery industry loses billions in sales\\nQueensland\\'s biggest plant-based rural industry is having, by its own admission, its worst year in two decades.\\nThe nursery industry had been worth about half a billion dollars in sales to domestic and export markets a year.\\nBut a drought in the south of the state has cut production and meant a 40 per cent drop in sales

at the time was the stock was blown over,\" he said.\\n\\nRemote families seek boost in allowances\\nFamilies of remote secondary students in the Northern Territory are calling for a higher interstate boarding and travel allowance.\\nThe Federal Government already provides boarding allowances for all isolated children, worth about $7,000 a year.\\nBut Tina McFarlane, from Stylo Station near Mataranka, says the Territory Government should provide extra funds to send isolated children interstate.\\nShe has even considered leasing the station to move the family closer to secondary schooling in Queensland.\\n\"I have a daughter going into secondary school and she has close family in Toowoomba,\" Ms McFarlane said.\\n\"There are boarding schools in the NT, but it\\'s nearly quicker to go interstate than to Alice and where there is family.\\n\\nProducers stop culling sheep\\nThanks to some much needed rain in Western Australia, producers in Northampton in the state\\'s wheatbelt region have now stopped culling their sheep.\\nIn the northern agricultural regions, around 13,000 lambs and ewes have been destroyed and another 15,000 have died, because the season has been too

said.\\n\\nEgg producers to be audited\\nVictorian egg producers are stepping up their quality assurance campaign, with a new system to ensure consumers get the egg products they pay for.\\nEgg farmers producing under the HenCare label will be audited to ensure they meet free-range farming, animal welfare and biosecurity standards.\\nThe president of the Victorian Farmers Federation egg group, Meg Parkinson, says the campaign is designed to eliminate suspicion that egg products are often sold under false labels.\\n\"There has always been a push by some people to say that egg farmers don\\'t do things very well and the eggs in the carton are not the ones they say on the label,\" she said.\\n\\nChlorine used to eradicate exotic marine pest\\nAn exotic marine pest has been eradicated, once again, from boats moored off Darwin Harbour.\\nThe black striped mussel was found on three illegal fishing boats, apprehended in Australian waters.\\nPeter Zeroni, from the Northern Territory Fisheries Department, says chlorine was used to kill the mussels, but monitoring will continue.\\n\"The vessels were treated in open water by a contractor with AFMA,\" he said.\\n\"The chlorine we used to treat the vessels obviously affected the mussels. The chlorine will have gone into the woodwork and is likely to kill anything else that\\'s in there.\\n\"So we are pretty confident those boats are safe now. However as a precautionary measure, they will be re-dived every month, any vessels of hulls that are moored in the harbour will be re-dived on an ongoing basis.\\n\\nCompany seeks new growers to help meet demand\\nA major Victorian company hopes to produce an extra million kilograms of fresh snow peas each year by recruiting new growers in south-east Queensland.\\nThe company, Select Produce, says it has been lured by water security and the favourable climate in the Bundaberg/Childers salad bowl.\\nThe business supplies the two major supermarket chains, with most of its produce coming from Victoria.\\nBut Queensland manager Lyle Wyatt says the company is recruiting growers in the Wide Bay area to help it meet demand all year round.\\n\\nCDMA network replacement on track: Telstra\\nTelstra has rejected suggestions the rollout of its new mobile phone network in rural Australia is facing major technical difficulties.\\nReports today claim trials of the billion dollar 3G network show the technology is not up to scratch and will not be able to provide the same quality and range as the current CDMA network.\\nWarwick Ponder from Telstra denies the claims, saying the program is still on track to replace CDMA by 2008.\\n\"We still stand by what we\\'ve said all along about this network,\" he said.\\n\"Today\\'s story in the Australian Financial Review is a bit like speculating about the performance of a racing car before the wheels have even been fitted.\\n\\nMore men call depression hotline\\nA national hotline to help men in rural areas cope with depression has received 500 calls in its first month.\\nChairman of beyondblue Jeff Kennett says 40 per cent of callers have been men, up from just 5 per cent.\\nMr Kennett says being able to receive help anonymously from even the most remote areas seems to be making a difference.\\n\"Unfortunately, depression is very prevalent throughout rural Australia and particularly among young men,\" he said.\\n\"So what we hope with this beyondblue information line is to give men the capacity, wherever and however isolated their environment may be, for the price of a local call to seek direction and help as to what to do in overcoming their depressive illness.\"\\n\\nSenate committee examines petrol collusion claims\\nWidespread rumours of collusion or price fixing between petrol companies will be examined by a Senate committee in Canberra today.\\nChairman of the Senate Economics Committee George Brandis says the inquiry will investigate issues that may contribute to high petrol and diesel prices.\\nSenator Brandis says the main focus will be trying to uncover the truth about collusion.\\n\"What we want to address, in particular, is the relationship between the oil majors and I am not saying that there are any anti-competitive practices, but there has been suggestion of that going back many years,\" he said.\\n\"But I think the point to be made is that this suggestion has been about for years but it has never been proved.\\n\"The ACCC has examined the matter and it has never found the existence of anti-competitive conduct.\"\\nThe committee will also look at the financial viability of ethanol and whether fuel taxes should be reduced.\\n\\nProject aims to boost zinc production at Mt Isa mine\\nResources company Xstrata has announced a $160 million project to turn its Mount Isa zinc mine into one of the world\\'s largest.\\nFred White, general manager for zinc metallurgical processing, says production will rise from 5 million tonnes a year to 8 million by the second half of 2008.\\nHe says the project also means more jobs for the region.\\n\"We\\'re looking at, for the duration of the project, having up to 200 extra people working in the concentrator providing construction engineering and contracting services, so it\\'s a good story for the area,\" he said. \\n\\nHunters dismiss fox fight call\\nA call from the Tasmanian Government for community help to hunt down foxes has been dismissed as a public relations stunt by professional hunters.\\nWith the discovery of a dead fox in the northern midlands a few days ago, the Government wants a task force of more than 100 people to track down the pest.\\nBut Peter Dark from the Field and Game Association says it is an old idea that did not work first time around.\\n\"It\\'s all very well to say \\'we\\'ll get a hundred hunters\\',\" he said.\\n\\nGraincorp to upgrade infrastructure\\nEastern states\\' grain handler Graincorp will spend $25 million on a major upgrade before this harvest.\\nMost of the money will be spent on better infrastructure at silos, along with appointing grains services managers at the 77 biggest receival sites.\\n\\nTaiwan market remains closed to cherry growers\\nCherry growers locked out of their $7 million market to Taiwan will not be allowed back in this year.\\nMost mainland regions were banned from exporting fruit in January because growers could not prove their cherries were free of the Queensland fruit fly.\\nDavid Minnis from the Cherry Industry Advisory Committee says trials to treat fruit for fruit fly will not finish until January next year.\\n\"It seems a long time away I know, but we\\'ve got to wait till the next season to do the full verification trial, then the evidence is written up in a format that we will then submit to the Taiwanese officials,\" he said.\\n\\nDraft seed import regulations worry growers\\nCut flower growers in northern Australia are renewing their calls for more time to comment on draft changes to seed import regulations.\\nBiosecurity Australia is reviewing the regulations, which Darwin grower Jan Hintze says will impact on flower breeding.\\nShe says they will also make it harder to conserve species like ginger, which is under threat from timber harvesting across Asia.\\n\"I think it\\'s a significant role that Australia should play within its sphere of interest,\" she said.\\n\"I mean these people that live in countries in South-East Asia and Asia, they are really concerned about the loss of this material too, but they can\\'t save it all on their own.\\n\\nFrosty mornings take their toll on wildflower industry\\nThe wildflower industry in Western Australia is the latest sector to be affected by the dry season.\\nBut it is not a lack of rain hampering production.\\nFrosty mornings are damaging the buds and Rhonda Tonkin of Coomberdale says it is the worst she has seen in 30 years.\\nMs Tonkin says she will probably lose some export markets this year.\\n\"If you don\\'t have enough product for the customers they tend to just cancel the container and go to India or somewhere else,\" she said.\\n\"But we are fairly unique in Australia with our dried flowers and the people are understanding because they know that we have a problem.\\n\\nCompany to streamline Australian operation\\nFurther rationalisation is occurring across the international

marketing sector has been forced to use its imagination to try to shift some of the billion litres of wine in storage across Australia.\\nOne of the latest ideas is a six pack of cleanskin wines in brightly coloured bottles, which have stoppers, so they can be reused as water bottles.\\nProfessor of wine marketing Larry Lockshin, from the University of South Australia, says there needs to be more innovation.\\n\"Right now when you say to somebody \\'wine\\', we think 750 millilitres in a glass bottle with a stopper of some sort, in Australia it might have a screw cap, other places might have a cork or a synthetic,\" he said.\\n\"But that\\'s a very traditional package, it\\'s been around for hundreds of years, so we haven\\'t been all that creative.\\n\"Look at how you buy milk, how you buy fruit juice, how you buy even tomato paste in the stores. We used to buy it in cans, now you can buy it in tubes like toothpaste.\\n\\nAWB announces new chief\\nThe head of Orica Mining Services has been named the new managing director of wheat exporter AWB.\\nGordon Davis, 50, will replace Andrew Lindberg, who quit at the height of the oil-for-food inquiry earlier this year.\\nMr Davis will be paid $875,000 a year, which is less than Mr Lindberg was receiving.\\nAWB chairman Brendan Stewart says Mr Davis\\'s role will be to stabilise the company and restore its credibility in the aftermath of the Cole inquiry.\\n\"I\\'m very conscious of the fact that Gordon should not be in any way, shape or form deemed to have been involved in anything that\\'s gone before us at AWB,\" he said.\\n\"He is new to the organisation, he is a cleanskin in that sense and we look very much forward to him running the business as it goes forward, and essentially the board, and myself, will be dealing with any issues that come out of the Cole inquiry.\"\\nMr Davis will start his role in mid-September.\\nMeanwhile the Grains Council has written to federal politicians looking for a guarantee that wheat growers will not be lumped with the costs of the Cole

intervene.\\nCoalition MPs will meet in Canberra on Monday to put forward ideas to ease the fuel price pain, including more help for the ethanol and biofuels industry, excise cuts and tax concessions for rural and remote areas.\\nFederal Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane has previously been opposed to extending help to the biofuels sector, but now says it will be considered if it leads to cheaper fuel costs.\\n\"The Federal Government is already providing some assistance to particularly the biofuels industry to get cheaper fuel onto the market and we are disappointed to date that part of that assistance is not actually reaching the motorists, so we\\'ll continue to look at options there,\" he said.\\n\"I guess Monday\\'s partyroom offers us the opportunity to hear what the backbenchers are suggesting and to consider some further options.\"\\nIn the United States, the peak body for corn growers in the mid-west believes biofuel production has brought life back to dying farming communities.\\nAlmost 60 million tonnes of grain is processed each year in the United States to make biofuels.\\nBruce Stockman from the Minnesota Corngrowers Association says ethanol has delivered a big boost.\\n\"Everyone of the communities that built one of these ethanol plants has come back to life,\" he said.\\n\"They were on the decline and they have vitality now.\\n\"The dollars that the state gave as an incentive for the first 15,000 gallons of production has paid the state back 16-fold.\\n\\nFarmers confidence falls\\nFarmer confidence has fallen due to lower demand, rising costs and poor seasonal conditions between April and June.\\nThe latest agribusiness survey by the National Australia Bank says beef, dairy, wheat, sugar and cotton farmers are less positive about the future.\\nThere is more optimism though for the wool and wine industries.\\nAnalyst Skye Dixon says the good news is that recent rainfall has boosted the price outlook for the next year.\\n\"Over the last 12 months, 2005-06 we saw rural commodity prices rise by around 4 per cent,\" Ms Dixon said.\\n\"This is largely in line with a steep rise in beef and sugar prices,\" she said.\\n\\nMining companies continue posting profits\\nEvidence of the resources boom continues to show-up on the financial markets, with record profits posted by Australian miners in the past 48 hours.\\nThe biggest result came from Rio Tinto, which has posted a profit of just under $5 billion for the half year.\\nRio produces iron ore, coal, diamonds, copper, alumina and uranium in mining operations around the

diamond find prompts mining hopes\\nDiamond mining in South Australia\\'s Flinders Ranges is a step closer after the discovery of 30 diamonds.\\nResources company Flinders Diamonds has been exploring the region for the past five years, but this is its most significant find.\\nManaging director Dr Kevin Wills says other results are yet to be studied, but so far the news is good.\\n\"Each of these samples we\\'re treating has got the chance of being an economic sample,\" he said.\\n\"Soon as we get to that stage, then we\\'ll convert to doing a feasibility study rather than an exploration program and that\\'s what we trying to find.\\n\\nFalling wheat crop to blame for AWB share drop\\nA Western Australian business analyst says AWB\\'s recent share price has been affected more by the falling wheat crop than its new managing director.\\nThe wheat exporter announced yesterday that Orica\\'s head of mining Gordon Davis will replace Andrew Lindberg next month.\\nShares in AWB slowly dropped during this week\\'s trade, but gained two cents this morning to hover around $3.74.\\nAshley Kelly from Bell Potter Securities says at this time of year the market sharply watches announcements about the grain pool.\\n\"The last update we had on the grain pool was back on the 31st of July, which wasn\\'t very long ago and of course those estimates were lowered,\" Mr Kelley said.\\n\"If you\\'re a betting person, then you\\'d probably bet there\\'s possibly another one to come.\\n\\nAnalyst says wool market performing well\\nElders says the wool market has performed well against the rising Australian dollar in the first sales after a three-week recess.\\nThe eastern market indicator fell five cents to 741 cents a kilogram this week, with 47,000 bales of wool on offer in Sydney and Fremantle.\\nIn Western Australia the indicator fell by 11 cents to 716 cents a kilogram.\\nWool analyst David Fogg says it is surprising there was not a bigger fall, given the two cent rise in the Australian dollar.\\n\"We really thought, particularly at the fine end, that we were going to see at least 20 and perhaps 30 come off prices, but what we saw in fact with the fine wools was 10 to 15 on the first day,\" Mr Fogg said.\\n\\nNine arrested after orchard raids\\nFruit orchards in Victoria\\'s Goulburn Valley were searched by police yesterday, resulting in the arrest of nine people on allegations of extortion, arson, drug offences and organised crime.\\nCharges are expected to be laid today.\\nNine orchards were raided yesterday at the culmination of a 12-month

banana and avocado farms were badly damaged by the cyclone and he says any extra assistance is welcome.\\n\"Any sort of help we get is much needed - it\\'s going to help with our existing labour force,\" Mr Rigato said.\\n\"Even though we\\'ve cut back it allows us to keep them [employees] going on, you know more time down the track.\\n\\nCitrus growers ask for frost assistance\\nRiverland citrus growers who have had crops decimated by frost have asked the Federal Government for exceptional circumstances assistance.\\nMore than 30 per cent of the region\\'s navel orange crop was ruined

Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran with the proposal.\\n\\'We effectively have said when we have one crop failure that is a significant and he said it had to be prolonged failure so we\\'re arguing that point of view at the moment,\" Mr Walker said.\\n\\nPoppy growers asked to boost production\\nTasmanian poppy growers have been asked at the last minute if they can plant an extra 2,000 hectares of poppies.\\nPharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline announced in April it would cut contracts by 90 per cent because of a world oversupply, but it has now secured a long-term deal that will clear out its reserve stocks.\\nSpokesman Mike Doyle says the company\\'s relationship with growers may have been damaged, but he hopes they will come to the party.\\n\"The timing\\'s unfortunate I admit,\" Mr

sea.\\nThe group has been aboard Australia\\'s biggest sail training ship, the Leeuwin II.\\nFor 14-year-old Riley Vaughan of Wave Hill Station south-west of Katherine, it was the chance of a life-time.\\n\"How hard it was to work a little sailing ship, I thought I had it tied down, it\\'d be pretty easy but it wasn\\'t good enough,\" Riley said.\\n\"I reckon the coils, the knots were the hardest, unfurling the sails, you have to climb up and and crawl out on the end of the sail and unroll it, but it was worth it.\\n\"Everyone once in their life should have a ride on the Leeuwin.\"\\n\\nVaile denies EU claims of bias\\nThe Federal Government has been accused of bias by the European Union by favouring the United States in negotiations for world farm trade reform.\\nEU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson has also snubbed Australia\\'s invitation to attend trade talks in Cairns next month, calling on the Government to stop criticising Europe\\'s farm policy.\\nBut Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile has flatly denied any allegations of bias.\\n\"Well we have always been very ambitious as far as market access on agriculture is concerned and I reject the notion that we are biased towards the United States,\" he said.\\n\"In fact we are the only country of the six in the G6 that put compromise proposals on all fronts, on market access, on cuts to domestic support and on changes as far as non agricultural market access is concerned.\\n\\nFarmers want Govt rethink on fuel tax\\nFarmers who are developing commercial biofuel plants are hoping the Federal Government will rethink its policy on taxing alternative fuels after a meeting of Coalition MPs this afternoon.\\nPublic concern over the high cost of petrol and diesel is expected to be a major issue at the gathering, although Prime Minister John Howard has ruled out cutting the federal fuel excise or subsidies for rural motorists.\\nStephen Hobbs from Kaniva in western Victoria says it is time the Government helped the rural community to reduce its dependence on big oil companies.\\n\"I think it\\'s just a really disappointing position that the Federal Government has taken with the whole renewable fuel industry, when you consider that the fossil industry has had 100 years to get it\\'s legislative framework in place,\" he said.\\n\\nCalls for former AWB lawyer to be cross-examined\\nAWB\\'s former in-house lawyer Jim Cooper is likely to give evidence to the Federal Court tomorrow, as the Cole Inquiry seeks access to 1,300 documents that may be relevant to the

consignment of wheat bound for Iraq will leave Port Giles in South Australia on Wednesday.\\nPart of the 350,000 tonne Wheat Australia deal, it is the first wheat from South Australia to leave the port for Iraq in almost two years.\\nABB Limited\\'s Maggie Dowling says the 23,000 tonne shipment is big news for the state\\'s wheat industry.\\n\\nPoor season affects lupin numbers\\nWestern Australian lupin growers are worried that poor seasonal conditions will cut this season\\'s production by two-thirds.\\nFarmers need to grow enough lupins each year to fill long standing overseas contracts, hold enough over to plant the following year and supply the domestic livestock industry.\\nWith lupins fetching $300 a tonne to meet strong feed demand in the west, Alan Meldrum from Pulse Australia fears there will now be a lack of seed to plant next season.\\n\"It\\'s obviously a very ordinary season, there\\'s not much production going to be happening from lupins in 2006 and the biggest concern is the great northern area where a lot of lupins are produced on an annual basis,\" he said.\\n\\nBid to increase cherry research, development industry fails\\nJust one vote has defeated a bid by the cherry industry to increase its research and development industry.\\nIan Hay from Australian Cherry Growers says the levy rise would have helped to open up export markets in China and Taiwan, by funding a fruit fly program.\\nHe says the industry is now working on an alternative proposal to put to producers.\\n\"It exists now at one cent per kilo, however the conference voted unanimously at executive level to go out in the ballot again, but this time at four cents per kilo,\" he said.\\n\\nMundubberra mandarins headed for China\\nThe first export shipment of citrus fruit to China has left Australia.\\nPreviously fruit entered China through the so-called \"grey channel\" via Hong Kong.\\nOn Friday a container of honey murcott mandarins from Mundubberra in Queensland\\'s central Burnett region left under China\\'s strict new export protocols.\\nThe shipment will reach Beijing towards the end of the month, meaning fruit supplier Alan Jenkins has a nervous wait.\\n\"We\\'ve done everything, we hope, right at this end,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve been certified and inspected by AQIS, and we hope that\\'s in line when it gets to China.\\n\\n$50m for aquaculture, seafood firm\\nA Western Australian businessman has launched a $50 million buy-up of aquaculture farms in South Australia.\\nAnalysts say the creation of a major seafood company could lead to better prices and major export deals for oyster growers.\\nThe company known as Aqafood has entered contracts to buy several oyster farms on the Eyre Peninsula and an atlantic salmon and ocean trout farming operation in the south-east.\\nAdelaide business broker Martin White says the venture could see more seafood being sold in untapped export markets.\\n\"It\\'s a progression the industry needs to take, in as much as there isn\\'t a corporatisation at all in a lot of the smaller aquaculture industries and I think to develop and grow the industries this is a positive approach,\" he said.\\n\\nDiggers and Dealers conference kicks off in Kalgoorlie\\nFifteen hundred miners have travelled from all over the globe to attend the annual Diggers and Dealers talkfest at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.\\nThe gold mining town is packed to capacity with some of the world leaders in the resource sector, with many delegates having to resort to camper vans and caravan sites for accommodation.\\nHowever, talk of moving the conference to a capital city is not being considered by chairman Brian Hurley.\\n\"If it was in Perth or Melbourne or Sydney it would just be another conference,\" he said.\\n\\nComalco port gets $78m upgrade\\nThe mining boom has seen record demand for aluminium, leading to record production of bauxite at Comalco\\'s Weipa mine on Cape York.\\nAfter producing 16 million tonnes last year, the company is on track to set a new record. To cope with growing demand, the company has spent $78 million upgrading its port.\\nThe main part of the upgrade is the installation of a second ship loader, which weighs 650 tonnes.\\nWeipa manager Rob Atkinson says it can fill giant ore ships in no time at all.\\n\"The ship loader is basically a device which allows the bauxite from the stockpiles to be directly loaded into a ship and then it allows the bauxite to be fed into the ship at a rate of about 6,500 tonnes an hour,\" he said.\\n\\nScientist calls on SA farmers to collect rabbit livers\\nA South Australian scientist is calling on landholders across the country to collect the livers from dead rabbits found on their properties.\\nIn October it will be 10 years since the calici virus was released in South Australia in an attempt to control rabbit numbers.\\nRon Sinclair from the state\\'s Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity says the livers will help researchers find out how the virus has evolved and whether it is still effective.\\n\"It\\'s not a very nice thing to do, to chop open a rabbit and take out a bit of liver, but we only need a little piece, about maybe a thumbnail size, chucked in a bottle and thrown into a freezer labelled and then call the local authority responsible for animal or plant control and let them know they have one,\" he said.\\n\\nThousands turn out for bush sports event\\nWhile more than 20,000 people are gathering for the annual Darwin Cup today, around 2,000 rolled up for the Hart Ranges bush sports in central Australia over the weekend.\\nRodeo, gymkhana, athletics and novelty events like the kangaroo tail toss and lizard racing kept guests entertained, but the big draw card was the amateur horses races.\\nA young French woman who works in local Aboriginal communities took out the prized events - the Stockman\\'s Bracelet, and the Stockman\\'s Cup.\\n\"I think on the first race, I\\'m not exactly sure but I was told I had about four lengths before the second horses, and on the second one I was a bit closer to the other horse, I think about two or three lengths as well in front of them,\" winner Alienor le Gouvello du Timat said.\\n\\nConcerns over CSIRO, Genetic Solutions deal\\nThere are concerns today that a new commercial relationship between Australia\\'s national science agency and a gene technology company could hurt long-term research projects.\\nCSIRO has signed an agreement with Brisbane-based Genetic Solutions to become a shareholder in the company in exchange for its research into cattle genes.\\nTraditionally CSIRO gets royalties and licensing fees for its work.\\nMick Keogh from the Australian Farm Institute is worried the deal may change CSIRO\\'s focus, so it is chasing profits rather than undertaking long-term research.\\n\"The New Zealand experience suggests that trying to have public research agencies be very strongly focussed on external earnings targets just diverts the whole thing,\" he said.\\n\"Everything becomes short-term, the long-term blue sky projects just get left on the shelf and everything\\'s about chasing earnings for this year or next year.\"\\n\\nAussies lose Iraqi wheat trade\\nA delegation from AWB has travelled to Iraq in an attempt to rebuild the company\\'s damaged reputation.\\nFigures out of the US suggest it now has 72 per cent of the wheat trade with Iraq, once Australia\\'s biggest grain export destination.\\nAWB chairman Brendan Stewart says the US is a major competitor and he cannot set a deadline on winning new wheat contracts.\\nHe says the meeting was requested by Iraqi authorities.\\n\"This is an initial re-engagement meeting and is really to talk about process, not to talk about tenders and prices and those sorts of things,\" he said.\\nMeanwhile, a group of grain growers - mainly from Western Australia - is investigating possible legal action against AWB.\\nThe WA Pastoralists and Graziers Association says it is researching whether there are irregularities with AWB\\'s incentive scheme.\\nThe group of growers is concerned that $200 million could have been deducted from income that should have gone to growers.\\nThe PGA\\'s Leon Bradley says a legal firm has agreed to act on its behalf to investigate concerns.\\n\"Well our first concern is that the benchmark itself is internally determined by the AWB and we\\'re concerned about its integrity,\" he said.\\n\"Secondly, with some of the evidence emerging at the Cole commission, we believe some of the prices that have been used to calculate their performance have been inflated.\"\\nAWB believes the PGA has misunderstood AWB\\'s incentive scheme.\\nThe company says will try to resolve the issue with the PGA before it embarks on legal action.\\n\\nDocuments decision\\nThe Federal Court has told lawyers for AWB and the Commonwealth to meet privately to cull the controversial list of 1,300 secret documents.\\nProceedings have been adjourned until this afternoon so the two parties can agree on a smaller and easier to manage list of communications between AWB and its lawyers.\\n\\nBeef prices predicted to stay high\\nThe outlook for the cattle industry remains bright, despite the lingering drought and the return of US beef exports to North Asia.\\nIn its latest projections, Meat and Livestock Australia says beef prices should stay at their current high levels because exports and domestic consumption are set to rise.\\nChief market analyst Peter Weeks says producers are continuing to pay top prices for grazing land, with production set for a record high next year.\\n\"Rarely seen such a buoyant period, you\\'ve really had four or five years where the industry has been what you could describe as buoyant,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve had this time round, we\\'ve got record prices, we\\'ve got near record production and we\\'re thinking by 2:30 we might even have record production.\\n\\n20,000 sheep up for sale online\\nThe sheep market is strong, with more than 20,000 sheep up for sale on the Internet in Queensland.\\nThat is three times the usual number.\\nRichard Murray from Landmark at Longreach says most of the sheep offered on Auctions Plus come from properties in western Queensland.\\nHe says graziers are capitalising on strong demand for young ewes from central New South Wales, although abattoir-ready sheep are dominating the market.\\n\"With the processor sheep, usually from mid August the prices tend to ease back a bit, so naturally people are trying to get their sheep onto the market before then,\" he said.\\n\"It also fits in with the shearings, most of the shearings are done and they\\'re sort of six to eight weeks off the board now, which is an ideal time to be selling the sheep.\"\\n\\nWool growers reject diazinon alternatives\\nThe peak body representing wool growers wants to hold on to access to a common lice control chemical, despite health concerns.\\nThe Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is recommending that diazinon no longer be used to dip or jet sheep.\\nWool Producers\\'s Greg Weller wants the authority to consider protective equipment and new methods for dipping, because some of the alternatives create other problems.\\n\\nClaims grain companies under performing\\nThere are claims today that Australia\\'s key grain companies are under performing on the stock market.\\nAnalyst Paul Jensz from Austock says AWB, ABB and Graincorp are returning between four and six cents for every dollar invested, compared to 10 to 15 cents for other investments.\\nHe says the poor performance cannot be blamed entirely on seasonal conditions, and grower shareholders need to have more trust in external investors and prepare for life without the single desk for wheat exports.\\n\"We would attribute maybe a third of the problem to seasonal issues,\" he said.\\n\"But we do think even with those issues there is at least 60 per cent, two-thirds of the problem really, attributed towards structural changes in the industry and some problems within particular companies.\"\\n\\nHigh temps hit US dairy farmers hard\\nA summer heatwave in the United States could be good news for Australian dairy exporters.\\nTemperatures above 35 degrees have taken a dramatic toll on dairy production in California, with many cows dying.\\nDairy analyst Steve Spencer from FreshLogic says production on the west coast could drop by 20 per cent this month.\\n\"California is the largest dairy state and that has a major impact on the industry,\" he said.\\n\"There has been a cut in production, which will tighten their internal market.\\n\\nLack of feed causing sheep to suffer: RSPCA\\nThe RSPCA is cracking down on farmers in WA, saying sheep are suffering due to a lack of feed.\\nOfficers have visited more than 50 farms in the driest parts of the state.\\nSpokeswoman Emma-Jane Morcombe says the organisation wants to help farmers to find enough feed so their livestock can get through the tough season.\\n\"You can call the RSPCA because we will come in and, as I said, we\\'re giving advice right now,\" she said.\\n\\nMurray River system needs \\'a lot of rain\\'\\nWater inflows to the Murray River system over the past five years have been the lowest on record and this year is shaping up to be another tough one.\\nWith inflows since 2001 at just 40 per cent of the long-term average, Trevor Jacobs from River Murray Water says a lot of rain is needed.\\n\"The catchments aren\\'t responding well yet to rainfall,\" he said.\\n\\nStellar season boosts machinery dealers confidence\\nOne of the best seasons in years in South Australia has machinery dealers confident of big sales at this year\\'s Eyre Peninsula Field Days.\\nHigh fuel prices and low commodities have not deterred thousands from attending the biggest event on every farmers calendar in South Australia.\\nThe Eyre Peninsula Field Days plays host to more than 650 sites of large machinery and rural supplies along the outskirts of the small town of Cleve, one-and-a-half hours north of Port Lincoln.\\nThe season in this part of the world has been treated well, with some saying it is one of the best they have seen. Others claim the stem rust could be the downfall of this year\\'s crop.\\n\\nKalgoorlie lacking gold treatment facilities, conference told\\nTreatment mills in Kalgoorlie in Western Australia are working overtime to turn as much ore into gold bars to take advantage of record gold prices.\\nThis week the Kalgoorlie region is hosting the Diggers and Dealers conference, attended by some of the world\\'s leaders in the resource sector.\\nAnalyst Dr Sandra Close has told the conference that local plants cannot keep up with the amount of gold being dug up to ship overseas.\\n\"One of the actual problems we are actually seeing - I guess, in a way, it is a good problem to have - and that is there is a lack of gold treatment facilities in the Kalgoorlie area,\\' she said.\\n\\nDivided views on wheat marketing\\nFour hundred delegates met at the Agriculture Australia conference and all eyes and ears were on a panel session - looking at the future of the wheat industry in the face of AWB inquiry. The key question was should growers retain the single desk, and if so, should they allow AWB to continue to manage it? The Grains Council of Australia, which represents state-based grains bodies, says producers want to keep the systems as it stands until the end of the Cole inquiry. But as pressure mounts from the impending cost of the inquiry, the Grain Growers Association, which represents 17,000 producers on the Eastern seaboard, says there\\'s little choice but to change. So what options should growers go with? On the one side, international traders who want to get a share in the market say growers have nothing to lose. On the other hand, AWB has staunchly defended the benefits of having a single marketer as the best way to maximise returns to growers.\\n\\nGrain dispute settled out of court\\nA legal dispute over grain warehoused by Creasy\\'s Grain Enterprises has been settled out of court. When Creasy\\'s collapsed last year, the receiver Ferrier Hodgson cited a 1933 High Court to claim title to a significant tonnage of grain stored under warehouse agreements. The Whillock family from the north-west, with financial and legal support from the Australian Farmers Fighting Fund, challenged that claim in the courts. A settlement of $97,000 has now been reached, returning the full market value of the grain to the Whillock family, plus a large portion of the legal costs. The NSW Farmers Association took up the fight for the Whillock family and the president, Jock Laurie, says although a legal precedent was not set it\\'s still a significant win for the family. Meanwhile, Jackie Whillock has mixed feelings about the case. She\\'s glad that they\\'ve received the full value of the grain, but disappointed the 1933 ruling hasn\\'t been overturned.\\n\\nLive at the Agriculture Australia 2006 conference\\nMatt O\\'Sullivan brings you National Rural News today live from the Agriculture Australia conference in Sydney.\\nMATTHEW O\\'SULLIVAN: Hello, I\\'m Matt O\\'Sullivan, bringing you National Rural News today from the Agriculture Australia conference in Sydney, the peak gathering for the grains industry.\\nAs you\\'d expect the future of the single desk for wheat exports is a hot topic, and confusion seems to be the common theme.\\nThe future of GM crops is also being debated today and, of course, there\\'s plenty of speculation about whether we\\'ll actually get a decent grain harvest this season - as the ongoing dry drags on, many parts of Australia desperately need follow up rains.\\nBut everybody seems to be talking about alternative fuels, with crude oil prices hitting new highs this week. Delegates believe it\\'s time the Federal Government offered new incentives to make the switch to ethanol and biodiesel.\\nDELEGATE: \"I think there is such an abundance of energy in Australia, you know, they\\'re not very worried about it. They might as well just sit on their arse and not worry about it.\"\\nDELEGATE: \"We\\'re not getting any results at all with the biofuel. The Government\\'s just not interested to mandate it, and this is not actually going to get off the ground until it\\'s actually mandated, so it\\'s really up to the Government.\"\\nDELEGATE: \"This issue is now on the table, it\\'s here. And we can\\'t afford to be sitting in here in three years\\' time not really knowing where we\\'ll be and not picking up on the advantage that is there right now.\"\\nDELEGATE: \"I fully support the biofuel concept in industry. I disagree with the fact that they\\'ll be getting an excise and I want a level playing field in terms of acquisition of raw material.\"\\nMOS: Certainly, there\\'s a feeling that the Government needs to do more, and the grains industry needs to do more as well to get on the front foot and make sure that grain growers have a big slice of this market for grain. There does seem to be a concern that Australia is a long way behind other countries in tapping into the ethanol and biodiesel markets. One of the speakers here today is Terry Reinhart from Advance Trading in the US. Thanks for joining us, can you give us an idea of the industry in the US?\\nTERRY REINHART: Today, it\\'s about a 4.2 billion gallon industry, which compares to five years ago when it was about a 1 billion gallon industry, and projections are that by 2010 it\\'ll be a 10 billion gallon industry.\\nMOS: So does a country like Australia have a long way to go to try and catch up to that? Can we catch up to that?\\nTR: The good news about ethanol is it\\'s a 3000-year-old process by which you take corn and distil it into ethanol, so it\\'s not real rocket science, and if you have the money it\\'s fairly quick to build. You can build a 100 million gallon plant in 15 to 16 months, so it\\'s not like it takes 20 years to develop this thing.\\nMOS: One of the big concerns here is from end users of feed grain, that it\\'ll be much more expensive and it\\'ll be harder to get access to that grain. How is the corn going into ethanol in the US affected the market there?\\nTR: To date, there hasn\\'t been any effect on the end user, because corn is still relatively cheap. Today in the US we\\'re over supplied with corn, which is one of the motivators to develop ethanol as a demand for corn, but down the road, as we continue to increase their production, we\\'re going to have to price corn as fuel as opposed to pricing corn as food and the livestock producer is concerned greatly in the US also.\\nMOS: That, I think, is going to be a growing theme, isn\\'t it, that you have more and more different types of grain going into producing fuel and into producing food, when that\\'s a big issue?\\nTR: Yeah, it\\'s a big issue, and you can kind of sum up the whole thing if you go back to, I think it was 1998, one barrel of crude would buy 4.7 bushels of corn and today one barrel of crude would buy 30 bushels of corn, so the price relationship strongly favours corn as a fuel as opposed to being a food.\\nMOS: In terms of the US industry, here in Australia we\\'ve got a lot of different plants setting up in small operations. There\\'s no sort of overall structure. Is that going to tell against Australia in the long run?\\nTR: I don\\'t know. In the US, there\\'s not much structure at this point either. The early people in the ethanol industry were the Cargills and the ADMs of the world. They\\'ve been making ethanol for quite some time, but all the new capacity or much of the new capacity is small start-up operations, groups of farmers going together investing in ethanol plants and there\\'s not much organisation today to all the ethanol plants that are out there and time will tell. My guess is some of these plants are built in the right place and some of them aren\\'t, and we\\'ll just have to see over time which ones were built in the right place.\\nMOS: I see a story quoting Sir Richard Branson saying he\\'s investing in ethanol plants in the US. Are they starting to attract that big business investment?\\nTR: Yes. Early on, four or five years ago, capital was a problem and you just worked and worked and worked to try and find enough money to build an ethanol plant. To put it in perspective, to build a 100 million gallon plant - which is the one they\\'re building now - it takes about $170 million to build that plant. Whereas five or 10 years ago it was terribly difficult to raise that money, today you\\'re hearing stories of people raising that kind of money in 30 and 60 day periods.\\nMOS: So there\\'s reason for farmers getting involved in this to have some hope that it will take-off?\\nTR: In the US, I\\'d say it has taken off, it really has. And the limiting resource in the US right now is plant capacity. And if we build all the plants that are on the drawing board today, the limiting resource is soon going to become farmland, enough land to produce enough corn to feed the ethanol plants.\\nMOS: Thanks for your time, Terry Reinhart from Advance Trading in the US.\\nYou\\'re listening to a special broadcast of National Rural News from the Agriculture Australia conference in Sydney.\\nOf course, alternative fuels hasn\\'t been the only item on the agenda here - an entire session has been devoted to the future of the single desk for wheat exports in the aftermath of the oil-for-food Inquiry.\\nReporter Alice Plate sat in on the session - and Alice, what\\'s the feeling about the future of our wheat export system?\\nALICE PLACE: Well the feeling has actually changed a bit. In the past, many growers, I think, have tried to separate the single desk issue, that is, AWB\\'s right to veto other exporters\\' applications to sell wheat overseas, from the ongoing oil-for-food inquiry. And yesterday, at the panel, many of the growers groups admitted that change is now inevitable.\\nMOS: They\\'re unsure though about what sort of system they want for the future, is that right?\\nAP: That\\'s right. Looking at the single desk marketing system, it\\'s not simple, by anyone\\'s analysis of it. Breaking it down, you\\'ve got on one side the traders, other major competitors - CBH, Graincorp, and the like - all trying to get into that market, saying that they can give growers better returns. And AWB, on the other hand, is saying that it can maximise returns for growers and give them security. But the Grains Council of Australia, which represents state-based grower bodies, says that the majority of growers don\\'t want a change from what they\\'ve got. They want AWB to stay there. They want the single desk. On the other hand, the Grain Growers Association, which is east coast grain growers, says growers do want to know more about their options, that they are really starting to question the current system.\\nMOS: So are they looking for more leadership from the grains bodies?\\nAP: That\\'s right. We did have a grower stand up yesterday and say, \"Why aren\\'t you putting forward options and recommending those to us?\" And we have seen the Grains Council of Australia, they have done independent reports, also they\\'ve looked at the Victorian Farmers Federation\\'s option for the single desk, but they\\'re saying they\\'re unwilling to analyse and make those recommendations until the Cole inquiry wraps up in September.\\nMOS: Thanks Alice. Speaking of the inquiry, AWB has told the Federal Court today it will cut by a third the number of documents it\\'s battling to keep away from the Cole inquiry. Lawyers for the wheat exporter have told the court that nearly 400 documents will be struck from the confidential list, leaving 900 still to be contested. And that hearing is continuing in Melbourne.\\nHere at the conference, reporter Michael Condon has been in one of the GM sessions. What has been discussed?\\nMICHAEL CONDON: One of the contentious issues surrounding the grains industry always is genetically modified crops, particularly food crops. Today we\\'ve heard a couple of distinct points of view expressed. We heard from the the director of scientific affairs for Monsanto. He\\'s actually addressing the conference as we speak now. Bit of a coup for the conference.\\nHe\\'s come from the United States saying that he knows that farmers already support GM crops. He says they get better yields. They use fewer chemicals. They have higher initial seed costs, but those are easily recouped. He\\'s saying thatHe\\'s saying that farmers are in favour. He does concede, though, that there is a bit of a way to go to convince consumers about eating the food that\\'s made from g-m crops. Monsanto, of course, famously put their GM wheat on hold for the time being. He says there are no plans to change that.\\nBut Mr Glick says he\\'s got a strong feeling that consumers will soon be convinced. They\\'ll come to the party, he says. They\\'ll realise that g-m crops can do all sorts of things. They can put in special oils to reduce heart disease. They can have certain complex carbohydrates to combat diabetes, and g-m foods also have less exposure to chemicals in the growing process. So he says he thinks they will be convinced.\\nMOS: What about the food companies? What do they think about that?\\nMC: At this stage, George Weston Foods general manager was here as well. He was asked that question. He said at this stage consumers aren\\'t ready. They\\'d prefer to see the segregation process remain. He was particularly relating to canola. Keep the oilseeds separate that are GM. The other, that\\'s non-GM is used in food. But he said too that he thought that eventually consumers would change their attitudes, and it was up to industry and up to research to try and find ways of promoting health benefits in GM to consumers as well.\\nMOS: Thanks Michael, reporter Michael Condon here.\\n\\nCole inquiry set to resume public hearings\\nThe Cole inquiry into the oil-for-food scandal will resume public hearings in

as save lives.\\n\"In WA we know that right now there is 97 per cent awareness of the \\'two and five\\' campaign, they have already increased the number of servings by one per day per person, we already see improved health within that community, we already see reduced health care costs,\" he said.\\n\"The producer also benefits through increased sales.\\n\\nWine blueprint to focus on new innovations\\nNew innovations dominate a new seven year blueprint for the Australian wine industry which was launched in Adelaide this morning.\\nCompiled by the Australian Wine Research Institute,

dismissed.\\nShe says she is worried about biosecurity problems from letting people on to her land.\\n\"I think we\\'ve got the right to continue with the farming that we\\'ve been doing for probably 40 years, and people before us, and people after us without having to worry about who\\'s coming and going, and opening, and shutting gates, or maybe not shutting gates and all that sort of thing,\" she said.\\n\\nMore women entering mining workforce\\nThe resources boom has led to a more women enter the mining workforce across Australia.\\nMore than 3,500 women have started work on mine sites over the past three years and now make up 18 per cent of the workforce.\\nAnd Mitch Hooke from the Minerals Council says the trend will have to continue to make up for a severe shortage of workers.\\n\"They are attracted by pay, yes they are attracted by the opportunity but they\\'ve started to see that the macho image of the mining industry is not quite as stringent as it was,\" he said.\\n\"Don\\'t forget women make the best truck drivers.\\n\"I mean we\\'ve got a couple of mine managers that are women, we\\'ve got an Indigenous female mining engineer.\\n\\nBull sale \\'solid\\'\\nIt was a big day in Broome in northern Western Australia yesterday, with Ladies Day at the races and the annual bull sale.\\nOne hundred and thirty-six beasts went under the hammer, with a Kimberley pastoralist paying the top price of $4,500 for a brahman bull.\\nTony Cooling from Landmark Broome says the sale was solid, without being outstanding.\\n\"We had a very very good clearance, the average was slightly up on last year so both the vendors were smiling and the purchasers all got the fair share of bulls,\" he said.\\n\\nNSW producer\\'s cattle sets record price at Ekka\\nA New South Wales beef producer has had a very successful trip to the Ekka in Brisbane.\\nAfter a 12 hour drive from Singleton, in the Hunter Valley, Greg Ball has scored wins in three of the

camembert takes out world cheese award\\nA Tasmanian camembert has beaten the country that invented it at a world cheese show in the United States.\\nThe winning sample from the National Foods\\' cheese factory in Burnie was up against 100 entries from all over the world, including the best from France.\\nChuffed cheese maker Kurt Wyss says the Tasmanian Heritage Signature Camembert is unlike any other in the world.\\n\"It really stands out compared to other camemberts as the flavour is a more fuller, earthier and a really, really creamy texture,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt accused of sitting on oil review\\nThe Democrats have accused the Federal Government of failing to force the major oil companies to meet their biofuels targets.\\nThe party believes the Government is sitting on a review which reveals the oil companies are less than halfway towards meeting their target of selling 350 megalitres of biofuel by 2010.\\nNationals Senator Ron Boswell also believes the oil retailers are not making a big enough effort to adopt alternative fuels.\\n\"I know fairly closely that from the time the Prime Minister called the oil companies in, the oil companies promised the Government that they would sell 89 million litres this year, we\\'re now almost in September and I would expect they\\'ve sold about 10 million litres,\" he said.\\n\"Now that is not honouring the commitment to the Government ... and they need to be brought to account.\"\\nThe Federal Government has defended the oil companies, saying they are on track to reach the target.\\nMeanwhile the nation\\'s peak motoring body says fuel prices could surge to a $1.80 a litre by the end of the year.\\nAlan Evans from the Australian Automobile Association says there has been trouble in the Alaskan oil fields, Nigeria and the Middle East which makes us vulnerable to a price increase:\\n\\nForrest defends decision to abstain on migration Bill\\nFormer National party chief whip John Forrest says his decision not to support the Federal Government\\'s controversial migration legislation is based on his personal experience of refugees\\' contribution to rural Australia.\\nMr Forrest resigned from the position yesterday after abstaining from the vote on the plan to detain and process all asylum seekers offshore.\\nThe Victorian-based member for Mallee says he has supported the visa cases of asylum seekers working in horticulture and local abattoirs and has visted others in detention.\\n\"We have literally got thousands of refugees living amongst us, more particularly along the Murray Valley but they are spread right across the electorate,\" he said.\\n\"When people meet these folks and listen to their story, their perception about them changes.\\n\\nBiodiesel price cut unlikely\\nThe country\\'s biggest oil refiner says it will not be offering incentives for biodiesel to match its announcement to make ethanol cheaper at the pump.\\nUnder a new program, Caltex and BP will offer ethanol-blended fuel at three cents per litre less than regular unleaded fuel.\\nCaltex government affairs manager Frank Topham says biodiesel is too expensive to cut prices for motorists.\\n\"Biodiesel is significantly more expensive than ethanol for us to purchase, for the producers to produce and therefore a three cents a litre discount will not be possible,\" he said.\\nCaltex has also rejected claims that it is not buying fuel from the county\\'s biggest biofuels producer.\\n\\nGovt lawyers seek access to secret AWB documents\\nLawyers for the Federal Government are fighting for access to a handful of secret AWB documents which it claims involve possible fraud.\\nIn submissions today, counsel for the Commonwealth, Ian Harrison SC, told Justice Neil Young in the Federal Court, the selected material must be released to the Cole inquiry, even if it is privileged because it indicates evidence of possible fraud.\\nMr Harrison said AWB inflated its wheat price to pay Tigris $8 million, with part of this money being used to pay $2 million in compensation to Iraq for iron filings contamination in wheat shipments.\\nMr Harrison said this was a clear breach of UN sanctions and fraudulent.\\n\\nThird party to oversee NLIS audit\\nThe Federal Government will appoint an independent third party to oversee an audit of the National Livestock Identification System database to address cattle producer concerns once and for all.\\nThe Australian Beef Association lobby group feared the audit would be conducted in-house,and not effectively address its claims that the electronic livestock tagging system is not working effectively.\\nBut Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has released the terms of reference for the 10 week audit and says he is just about to appoint a major accounting firm to run it.\\nHe says every major group will have a say.\\n\"The Australian Beef Association will be contacted and their concerns will be completely and fully explored,\" he said.\\n\\nWool growers urged to keep research levy\\nWool producers are being urged not to lodge a protest vote against maintaining the 2 per cent levy which funds research, development and marketing by Australian Wool Innovation (AWI).\\nWith plans afoot to merge AWI with Australian Wool Services (AWS), some growers are worried their funds will be used to pay a $27 million debt owed by AWS in the United Kingdom.\\nChairman of WoolPoll 2006 John Keniry understands growers are hurting from the drought and low wool prices, but says cutting the levy will create new problems.\\n\"Zero per cent means that there is no levy income,\" he said.\\n\"If there is no levy income from growers then there is also no contribution from the Federal Government and that means there is no ongoing income for AWI.\\n\"AWI would spend the reserves it has simply to finish off the contracts that are currently in place and then turn out the light, which, from my personal view as a wool grower, would be a sad event if we just walked away from research altogether.\"\\nThe WoolPoll vote closes on November 3.\\nThe wool market remained steady this week, the eastern market indicator up just one cent to 742 cents per kilogram.\\nThe market remained unchanged in the west.\\n\\nNew regulations restrict animal health work to vets\\nUnder proposed new animal welfare regulations in New South Wales, a range of routine animal health procedures will be restricted to vets.\\nFrom September 1, vets will be responsible for dehorning cattle, and mulesing sheep over a year old, and castrating cattle, sheep and

to accept 3,500 tonnes of fruit this year, but spokesman Chris Ellis says the global market is oversupplied and it is hard for Australia to compete.\\n\"I think we were hopeful that the Greek crop might be diminished this year or that some sort of political trading resolution would have come and the situation would have eased,\" he said.\\n\"For those growers impacted they\\'ve got to find another opportunity.\\n\\nWine expert predicts grape glut\\'s end\\nA leading wine authority says Australia\\'s grape glut will soon be over and it is nothing to worry about.\\nAuthor of the Wine Atlas of Australia James Halliday says boom and bust cycles are a normal part of agriculture.\\nHe says like sugar, wine will revive.\\nHe has played down the fact that up to 100,000 tonnes of grapes were left unpicked in the last Australian harvest.\\n\"That\\'s still only 5 per cent of the total potential harvest, so it\\'s by no means as dramatic as the headlines would have you believe,\" he said.\\n\\nAust firefighters help battle US blazes\\nA team of 47 Australian and New Zealand firefighters have flown to the United States to help battle some of the worst summer wildfires in more than a decade.\\nThe crew is on a four-week deployment in the western part of the US, where more than 40 fires are burning.\\nJeff Pike from Victoria\\'s Department of Sustainability and Environment says Australian firefighters will have to work in unfamiliar conditions.\\n\"Most of their fuel is soft wood fuel systems, pine spruces and fuel like that,\" he said.\\n\"The elevations they operate at are a little higher than here.\\n\\nQld\\'s finest cattle on show at Ekka\\nThe who\\'s who of Queensland\\'s cattle industry is at one place today - at the Brisbane Ekka.\\nThe Ekka is playing host to one of the nation\\'s most prestigious cattle competitions.\\nThe cattle are bringing good prices at today\\'s auction.\\nNumbers are down a little at the Ekka prime cattle competition this year, numbers of cattle that is, but there are certainly plenty of people.\\nBetween 200-300 have gathered around to hear how much Queensland\\'s meat processors are prepared to pay for the cream of Queensland\\'s fat cattle.\\nAlready the grand champion pen of six limousin, exhibited by Eddie Nolan from southern Queensland, has made 250 cents per kilogram liveweight.\\nGrand champion steer of the show, another limousin, made 305 cents a kilo.\\n\\nNoxious weed found to benefit salmon\\nA Tasmanian scientific researcher is turning one of Australia\\'s most noxious weeds into beneficial omega-3 oils.\\nMatthew Miller has found that feeding pattersons curse, or salvation jane, to salmon significantly increases their levels of the healthy oils.\\nMr Miller began using oil extracted from the weed as fish food after identifying the particular compounds needed to stimulate omega-3 production.\\n\"Patterson\\'s curse have this really unique special oil and pattersons curse has the highest level of this oil,\" he said.\\n\\nSnowy River to reap benefits of western water project\\nA big water-saving project is being officially opened in western New South Wales today, with benefits

University of Melbourne, says almost one in five teenagers are leaving their regional towns to access termination services.\\n\"Eighteen per cent of teenagers had travelled over 100 kilometres, 28 women in our sample had travelled from interstate,\" she said.\\n\"Twenty of those were from New South Wales and 10 of those were from the Albury region.\\n\\nCowra Abattoir in receivership\\nThe abattoir at the centre of a row over the Federal Government\\'s new industrial relations laws has been placed into receivership.\\nTwo hundred workers were locked out of the Cowra Abattoir in New South Wales this morning, and meat supplies to local butcher shops were suspended.\\nThe plant hit the headlines earlier this year when management sacked 29 workers under the IR laws, and offered to rehire them on different conditions.\\nCharlie Donzo, from the Meat Employees Union, says a new workplace agreement had been developed, and he is surprised and disappointed.\\n\"This is absolutely devastating, not only for myself but for the workers at Cowra,\" he said.\\n\"Given the problems we have had over the last three or four months, and the efforts that the fellows have put into putting in a new agreement in place to make the plant more efficient and that.\\n\\nShipment fodder blamed for livestock deaths\\nThe use of new fodder on four live sheep shipments last year is being blamed for a slight rise in livestock death rates.\\nMeat and Livestock Australia (MLA) and Livecorp figures show small increases in mortality rates for sheep and cattle during 2005, and a slight fall in goat deaths.\\nOut of 4.2 million sheep exported last year, 0.95 per cent died.\\nMLA general manager Mike Hayward says that was largely due to the fodder, which was less dusty but contained less fibre and nutrients.\\n\"It essentially led to an increase in mortalities because a more than normal number of the sheep failed to eat,\" he said.\\n\"There was a higher level of disease in the animals as a result of that lack of fibre.\\n\"It was as simple as that.\"\\n\\nSingle desk changes \\'would hit AWB shares\\'\\nInvestment banker JP Morgan says shares in wheat exporter AWB could drop to $2.80, if the company loses control of the single desk for wheat exports.\\nShares fell last week to $3.36, which is lower than the company\\'s debut price on the Australian Stock Exchange.\\nAn analysis by the banker also shows that AWB\\'s share value would hover around $4 a share if it held onto the single desk but more competitors were allowed to sell wheat overseas.\\nGreg Canavan, a senior equities analyst from Fat Prophets, says that is not surprising given AWB\\'s experience in wheat sales.\\n\"When you look at the whole structure of the market AWB, given its monopoly position, does have a very big market share,\" he said.\\n\"If it didn\\'t have to give that market share up then it would still be in competition with the other players coming in.\\n\\nUS wheat forecast continues to drop\\nThe US wheat production forecast continues to slide but there has been a sharp rise in grain prices.\\nThe latest US Agriculture Department wheat estimate is off another 5 million bushels from last month at 1.8 billion.\\nBut that is just a small decline compared with the 14 per cent drop so far from the last marketing year.\\nUSDA\\'s World Agricultural Outlook Board chairman Gerald Bange says the bigger story is a 20 cent price increase on tightening competitor production in Argentina, Canada and the EU.\\n\"EU-25, in particular, was down pretty sharply,\" he said.\\n\"We can down 6.8 million tons on our estimate of their 06/07 crop and the reason for that is they were hit really hard by some real extreme heat in June and July.\"\\n\\nFarmers fear further chemical bans\\nFarmers are worried the Federal Government will ban access to more chemicals commonly used in agriculture, in response to last week\\'s terrorism arrests in the United Kingdom.\\nSome say restrictions on the ammonium nitrate fertiliser have made the chemical prohibitively expensive.\\nThe Victorian Farmers Federation says the future of another 84 fertilisers, herbicides and fumigants is being considered by the Government.\\nSpokesman Geoff Kendall says because farmers already have to obtain training certificates for many of the chemicals, the Government should not over-react.\\n\"We understand it will be the farmers won\\'t have access to these products,\" he said.\\n\"Basically they\\'ll be banned from using them in the future so we\\'re very very concerned.\\n\\nWorld Bank urges seasonal work visas for islanders\\nThe World Bank has backed farmers\\' calls for unskilled Pacific Island workers to fill labour shortages in Australia.\\nThe Federal Government has previously rejected any changes to the visa scheme which allows skilled migrants into the country\\nBut the bank says the Government could introduce a pilot program, allowing islanders to spend part of the year working in seasonal labour jobs.\\nSenior economist Manjula Luthria says the the islanders need the work or some Pacific economies could collapse.\\n\"Forty per cent of the population are youth and in less than 10 years from now, they\\'re going to want to be making the transition from working basically off the land to paid employment,\" he said.\\n\"A small percentage are actually going to find it domestically.\\n\\nSupply increase slashes macadamia prices\\nAn increased world supply has cut the price of macadamia nuts by almost half and investors are counting the cost.\\nUp to 20 per cent of macadamia farms have changed hands in the past two years, due to strong demand and sustained industry growth.\\nBut Andrew Heap, from the Australian Macadamia Society, says increasing fuel costs and mortgage repayments has now hit consumer demand.\\nHe says over-investment on some farms will create problems.\\n\"Most of those investors have been in a financial position to pay more than the agricultural value say these farms are worth,\" he said.\\n\\nCattle TB surveillance program nears end\\nAfter more than 30 years, the tuberculosis surveillance program for cattle will wrap up at the end of this year.\\nThe nation-wide program has been monitoring the health of cattle in northern Australia since 1970.\\nThe chief veterinary officer in the Northern Territory, Brian Radunz, says it is seven years since tuberculosis was detected there, and he is 99.9 per cent certain it has been wiped out.\\n\"Due to the nature of TB you can always have a infection hidden out there but it\\'s very unlikely given the fact that for the last 10 or so years if we have found infection we have been removing all the animals that have been exposed to that infected animal,\" he aid.\\n\"So unless there\\'s some undetected infection around we should never detect it.\\n\\nLogging detrimental to possums\\' sex life: study\\nThe results of a five-year study claims farming and logging is having an impact on the sex life of possums.\\nThe mountain brush tail possum of north-eastern Victoria has been in the spotlight, and found to only have one mate in areas which have been cleared.\\nProfessor Jenny Martin, from the University of Melbourne, says monogamy is rare in mammals, and it is occurring because there are fewer trees for sleeping and eating.\\n\"But at the other site where there was heaps and heaps of large trees with hollows, huge amounts of food trees and most importantly that those two types of trees were very close to one another, females could have extremely small home ranges while still getting access to the same amount of resources in terms of food and shelter,\" she said.\\n\\nRain cheers Louth race goers\\nRecent rain was a reason to celebrate at the 48th annual Louth races in western New South Wales over the weekend.\\nAfter almost a decade of drought, the red dust has been replaced by a blanket of green.\\nAbout 4,000 people flocked into Louth and committee president Tess Le Leviere says the rain made a difference.\\n\"People started working about two months ago on the different jobs and they get together at the pub and talk about it and by the time it is the day there\\'s been a lot of excitement and people forget just for a little while their problems,\" she said.\\n\"We\\'ve been very lucky because we\\'ve have three inches - nearly four - of rain over the last six weeks and everything\\'s very green.\\n\\nFirst independent sugar shipment leaves Cairns\\nThe first shipment of sugar from two Queensland mills operating outside the industry\\'s single desk has left Cairns bound for China.\\nQueensland Sugar Limited\\'s monopoly on export sales has ended under deregulation, with the

his mark in England, after being invited to judge at the prestigious Great Yorkshire Show.\\nRod Summers, who owns Maranga Stud at Evandale in Tasmania, was the mandatory independent judge of the belted galloway breed.\\nIn true Australian style he managed to ruffle a few feathers before proving he knows his stuff about the British breed.\\n\"A lady took me to task [about] why she was placed fourth instead of third after I swapped them, before I ordered the ribbons,\" he said.\\n\"Anyway, then she explained to me how the beast I\\'d placed third she\\'d sold last year and the beast I\\'d placed fourth was the one she\\'d kept.\\n\\nDemand fuels lobster breeding research\\nAustralian marine scientists are trying to farm tropical lobsters, in a bid to meet the insatiable appetite of the Chinese.\\nChina is prepared to pay $30 a kilogram and demand cannot be met from wild stocks.\\nMike Hall, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, says the biggest challenge to farming lobster is overcoming the disease problems which kill young larvae.\\n\"If we can get these animals from eggs through the larval phase and through the grow out phase to harvesting in a very short time, or in a short time, you\\'re going to have a higher profit margin than one that takes extremely long,\" he said.\\n\\nCannery wins US export deal\\nAustralia\\'s last tuna cannery has secured a $40 million export deal with the United States.\\n\\nGrowers urged to aid canker-hit farms\\nAustralian Citrus Growers wants members to donate money to help colleagues in central Queensland affected by the canker outbreak.\\nMore than half-a-million trees were destroyed following the detection of the disease near Emerald in July 2004.\\nThe Queensland and Federal governments are footing 80 per cent of the bill but industry needs to contribute about $200,000.\\nPresident Mark Chown is hoping other regions will help out.\\n\"People can contribute as much as they wish,\" he said.\\n\"We understand times are very tough for all growers at the moment, however, these people have had their entire orchards removed.\\n\"Looking out the back door there\\'s nothing, so we\\'re very concerned about that and this project was put forward and we\\'ve been eager to be involved.\"\\nAnd as the winter citrus season wraps up in the Riverland and Sunraysia, fruit exports to China are looking shaky.\\nGrowers have gained official access to the country but they are worried about a tough quarantine protocol to keep the pest, fuller\\'s rose weevil, out of China.\\nThe Federal Government has rejected calls to underwrite the initial fruit shipment.\\nBut Andrew Green, from SA\\'s Citrus Industry Development Board, has not given up hope.\\n\\nWA pushes for federal drought relief funds\\nThe West Australian Government will apply for exceptional circumstances (EC) relief for some of the state\\'s worst drought-affected regions.\\nIt is in negotiations with the Federal Government to roll

worst he has seen anywhere in Australia.\\n\"It\\'s the driest start in history,\" he said.\\n\"In the northern areas ... all chances are gone.\\n\"Mullewa, Morowa, through there, it simply hasn\\'t rained and that goes right out to the coast to Northampton - up there they just simply haven\\'t had a winter at all.\\n\\nFarmers welcome migration Bill\\'s collapse\\nFarmers are among those who have welcomed the Federal Government\\'s decision to abandon its proposal to detain and assess all asylum seekers offshore.\\nPrime Minister John Howard has withdrawn the legislation because the Government did not have the numbers to get it through the senate.\\nIan Skiller says 90 per cent of the asylum seekers he employs on his farms at Tooleybuc, in north-west Victoria, are farmers who lost their own properties in the Afghan war.\\n\"The thing that annoys me is that they have knowledge of horticulture and farming and it seems a waste that we\\'re not utilising those skills,\" he said.\\n\"I think they\\'re an asset to the area.\\n\\nGovt to hear farmers\\' chemical access concerns\\nThe Federal Government says it will listen to farmer concerns before deciding whether to restrict access to more agricultural chemicals in the wake of the latest terrorism threat.\\nThere is currently a review of 84 herbicides, fungicides and fumigants.\\nFarmers are worried that a new licensing system being considered by the Government will make the chemicals too expensive.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran says there needs to be a balance between security concerns and farming needs.\\nBen Fargher, from the National Farmers Federation, is hopeful the Government can be persuaded to keep existing training and certification programs instead.\\n\"We will sit down with government, we will explain how the current schemes work with government,\" he said.\\n\"There is government involvement in this and government people I have spoken to are aware of the industry schemes.\\n\\nBJD trace proves NLIS\\'s worth: vet\\nThe Queensland Government has rejected criticism of the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS), after using it for the first time to track six potentially diseased cattle across three states.\\nThe system, which aims to achieve whole-of-life traceability, has been accused of being inaccurate and costly, and is now subject to an independent audit.\\nBut Queensland\\'s principal veterinary officer, Dr Rick Webster, says the system has been used to trace cattle from a herd diagnosed with Bovine Johnes disease (BJD), avoiding a costly eradication program.\\n\"Because of NLIS we were able to check the records and see that all six animals had all been slaughtered and they had only spent time alive in feedlots,\" he said.\\n\\nMiddle East unrest hits cattle exports\\nThe conflict in the Middle East is affecting some sectors of the live export cattle trade.\\nIsrael is a consistent buyer of large bulls from the Kimberley in far north Western Australia.\\nBut over the past month, inquiries have eased and prices have dropped 20 to 30 cents a kilogram.\\nElders livestock agent Kelvin Hansey says the instability between Israel and Lebanon has hurt the small bull market.\\n\"I mean it\\'s a 30 per cent drop in the price already, and has the potential though to stop for several months,\" he said.\\n\"They are big events, these international events.\\n\\nAbattoir\\'s closure hits lamb prices\\nLivestock prices in New South Wales have reacted to the closure of the Cowra Abattoir, with lamb prices falling $3 to $4 a head.\\nAn administrator was appointed and the abattoir\\'s operations were shut down yesterday.\\nManagement claims the meatworks had been losing between $30,000 and $50,000 a week.\\nChris Grove, from the New South Wales Sheep Meats Council, is concerned that there is one less buyer in the market.\\n\"What it will probably mean will be a downturn in competition,\" he said.\\n\"One less buyer means less competition but it is just to be hoped that there is enough competition in the market.\\n\"A big problem we are facing in the industry, all the meat industry and the sheep industry, is the reduction in kill capacity.\\n\"Of course this has been made worse by closure of Cowra Abattoir.\\n\\nCattle feedlot to host ethanol plant\\nInternational investment firm Babcock and Brown is planning to build a $120 million ethanol plant at a cattle feedlot in southern New South Wales.\\nThe proposed facility at Rockdale Beef at Yanco will produce up to 150 million litres of ethanol a year, and the grain by-product fed to the cattle.\\nRockdale\\'s general manager Paul Trojah says the ethanol production will complement the feedlot\\'s plans for a biogas plant to generate electricity from cow manure.\\n\"Rockdale Feedlock will be producing about five megawatts of energy a day from all of the waste streams,\" he said.\\n\\nFarmers question fuel package benefits\\nThe Federal Government has pumped $1.5 billion into a plan to tackle high fuel prices, but there are questions over whether the farm or transport sectors will benefit.\\nAlmost half of the package will cover the cost of converting and installing LPG tanks.\\nGrants of up to $2,000 for the conversion are available immediately.\\nBut it is not expected to benefit farmers because it only applies to private users, and most farmers use machinery run on diesel, which cannot be converted to LPG.\\nThere are also concerns conversions will be delayed because of a huge demand and limited resources.\\nA three-year program to help service stations adopt equipment to sell ethanol-blended fuel, has also been announced.\\nBut the biofuels industry would have preferred a mandate for ethanol-blended fuel and more pressure on oil companies to buy ethanol.\\nThe Federal Government will also spend $123 million to encourage people to use wind and solar power over generators in remote communities.\\nThere is $76 million to encourage more oil exploration.\\n\\nFishing industry\\nThe fishing industry says the fuel package is of no assistance.\\nNeil Green, from the Queensland Seafood Industry Association, says primary producers have been hoping for excise cuts to reduce fuel costs.\\n\"I don\\'t think politicians, in particular the Prime Minister, actually realises where the fishing industry is,\" he said.\\n\"Financially we\\'re on a knife\\'s edge and fuel is our big cost.\\n\\nFines for minor breaches may exacerbate driver shortage problem\\nLivestock transport operators are concerned that new fatigue management measures proposed by the National Transport Commission could force drivers out of the industry.\\nThe commission\\'s proposal to improve driver fatigue suggests a demerit system for log book offences, the same system used for general traffic offences.\\nRoss Fraser from Frasers Transport in Queensland says while road safety is paramount, the shortage of drivers will get worse if they start being fined for minor breaches.\\n\"We\\'re really concerned about it because we\\'re getting drivers who are at the moment being fined for 15 minutes over in their log book - 15 minutes over a driving period that may have happened three weeks ago,\" he said.\\n\\nACCC recommendations threaten phone rental parity\\nThe cost of phone line rentals in regional Australia could rise dramatically if the Federal Government accepts new recommendations from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).\\nTelecommunications consultant Gavin Priestley says the ACCC has recommended a wholesale line rental of $7.00 a month for CBD customers, but $34 for major regional centres.\\nHe says that means rental costs for lines in smaller communities could rise much higher.\\n\"What it signals is the average of the access prices for telephones right across Australia is going to change and our worst fears potentially are going to be realised,\" he said.\\n\"That is country people will not get parity and will pay more for access to their phone line.\\n\"When the sale of Telstra was touted we were guaranteed that we would get parity of price and future proofing of the service. This is certainly not parity.\"\\nThe National Farmers Federation (NFF) says it is concerned and seeking more detail from the Communications Minister.\\n\\nUS grain growers anxious to control ethanol plants\\nAustralian investment in US ethanol plants is causing a stir among US grain growers, who are anxious to hold onto control of their new industry.\\nMid-west US producers said at a farm bill listening session they are concerned foreign investors that Wall Street might gain too much control of US ethanol production.\\nNational Farmers Union president Tom Buis says \"it\\'s been a 30-year struggle, basically by farmers to get this industry kick-started. And now that it\\'s arrived, they just don\\'t want to sit back and watch the control and all the profits go elsewhere\".\\n\\nSugar prices drop\\nWorld sugar prices have fallen below 13 US cents a pound, down from a high of more than 18 cents earlier this year.\\nIt is bad news for Australian growers, who are about halfway through the harvest and had been hoping for a breakthrough season.\\n\\nLabor claims underdog status in Qld election\\nWater and health are expected to dominate the Queensland state election, set for September 9.\\nIt is 65 years since a Labor government won a fourth term in office in Queensland.\\nBut despite holding 60 of the 89 seats in State Parliament the party is claiming underdog status, in part because its lost the last three by-elections and at least 10 sitting members, including a number of ministers, are not contesting this poll.\\nThe Liberal Party has a new and untested leader who has been in the job for less than a week and the Coalition needs to win 22 seats to take office.\\nThe key issues are the water crisis in the south-east and the stressed health system statewide.\\nThe Premier says his plans for a south-east water grid and a $9 billion injection into health over the coming years will solve the problems.\\n\\nFarmers urged to lobby for weed bio-control programs\\nScientists are calling on farmers to lobby for more natural ways to control weeds.\\nThe Co-operative Research Centre for Weed Management says the use of bugs and diseases to control invasive plants over the past 100 years has provided $10 billion worth of environmental and agricultural protection.\\nDespite criticism that natural control methods are too slow and unreliable, Dr Rachel McFadyen says the new research suggests previous efforts have prevented invasive plants from wrecking the environment.\\n\"What we\\'re saying to farmers is if farmers have got a significant problem year after year then they should be asking their agriculture representatives and their state government members, is there a bio-control program against this weed?\" she said.\\n\"And if there is, does it have enough funding to get it going and if there isn\\'t why is there one?\\n\"Because it\\'s one of the best returns on money that they can get.\"\\nMeanwhile large tree cropping companies in Western Australia are opening their gates to agist sheep from drought-stricken farms.\\nIntegrated Tree Cropping has 70 plantations in the state\\'s south-west and wants to use sheep to control weeds.\\nSpokesman Andy Wright says it should help the company too by saving thousands of dollars a year on pesticides.\\n\"We would have to carry out management on those weeds,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'d have to spray the weeds within the plantation or we would have to slash round the outside of the plantation.\\n\\nWool bodies launch national mulesing assurance program\\nThe wool industry\\'s peak bodies have launched a national mulesing assurance program to try to reassure wool processors that animals are being treated humanely.\\nAustralian Wool Innovation and Wool Producers will improve training for 1,200 mulesing contractors by the end of the year to minimise pain and suffering for animals.\\nUnder the practice of mulesing, skin is cut from the backside of lambs to reduce the risk of flystrike.\\nSecretary of the program, Charlie De Fegely says the wool industry wants to show it has ethical standards.\\n\"I\\'ve even heard of some contractors paying for their producers to do it simply because they want to have best practice and they don\\'t want to be part of holding the industry back,\" he said.\\n\\nWool growers want to postpone wool levy vote\\nThe Australian Wool Growers Association will ask the Federal Government to delay an industry vote on the future of the wool levy.\\nThis year\\'s Woolpoll is asking growers to support an ongoing 2 per cent levy to fund research, development and marketing by Australian Wool Innovation (AWI).\\nBut with AWI planning a merger with Australian Wool Services, the association\\'s Martin Oppenheimer says growers need more information about the new organisation before they can make a decision.\\n\"At the moment in the current climate there\\'s no way that wool growers are going to be able to afford extra levies,\" he said.\\n\"What they want to be able to do is to split their levies between research and marketing.\\n\\nGreen light given to third poppy processor\\nA third poppy processor has been given the green light by the Tasmanian Government.\\nTPI Enterprises has been permitted to manufacture and sell narcotics from a small trial plot, but managing director Jarrod Ritchie says it is a significant step.\\nHe is hoping to lock in future orders, despite a world oversupply of poppy-derived products.\\n\"There is price pressure on morphine, I don\\'t think anyone\\'s denying that,\" he said.\\n\"Countries like Turkey are sitting on significant stockholds but we see our main focus as being thebaine and we\\'re very confident of getting those markets.\\n\\nMystery virus wipes out flying foxes\\nThe skies around the Northern Territory town of Katherine have been clearer over the past 10 months, due to a mystery virus that is wiping out large numbers of native \\'little red\\' flying foxes.\\nWhile the mammal is considered a pest to farmers and townsfolk, the scientific community is concerned the ecological system will suffer from a 50 per cent reduction in flying fox numbers.\\nAndrew Pickering from Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife says no one knows what impact the fall in numbers will have.\\n\"There\\'s possibly a roundworm and a virus, not knowing exactly what to pinpoint,\" he said.\\n\"Flying foxes are actually a huge ecological benefit to the bush around here as pollinaters and seed distributors and so the loss of those big mega colonies that we typically have they can number up to hundreds of thousands have disappeared at least from the Katherine region.\"\\nMeanwhile for the first time all efforts to manage the fruit fly are being recorded in a national stocktake.\\nIt is looking at surveillance, research and development, market access and trade, and quarantine inspections.\\n\\nFarmers hail success of tuna trial program\\nTuna farmers are hailing the success of a trial program to catch fish all year round.\\nTo test growth and health levels, 65 tuna have been held in cages off Port Lincoln in South Australia for the past 17 months which is four times longer than usual.\\nThe fish were harvested yesterday and David Ellis from the Tuna Boat Owners Association says they were in excellent health.\\n\"We\\'re going to get the weight and the length of the fish, to see\\nhow much they\\'ve grown,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve also taken product quality samples or flesh samples so we\\'re looking at how long or how red it stays for in shelf life.\\n\\nACCC recommendations threaten phone rental parity\\nThe cost of phone line rentals in regional Australia could rise dramatically if the Federal Government accepts new recommendations from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).\\nTelecommunications consultant Gavin Priestley says the ACCC has recommended a wholesale line rental of $7.00 a month for CBD customers, but $34 for major regional centres.\\nHe says that means rental costs for lines in smaller communities could rise much higher.\\n\"What it signals is the average of the access prices for telephones right across Australia is going to change and our worst fears potentially are going to be realised,\" he said.\\n\"That is country people will not get parity and will pay more for access to their phone line.\\n\"When the sale of Telstra was touted we were guaranteed that we would get parity of price and future proofing of the service. This is certainly not parity.\"\\nThe National Farmers Federation (NFF) says it is concerned and seeking more detail from the Communications Minister.\\nBut chief executive Ben Fargher says he is confident rural line rentals will remain capped, under what is says is an \"iron clad\" deal between the NFF and the Government.\\n\\nACCC recommendations threaten phone rental parity\\nThe cost of phone line rentals in regional Australia could rise dramatically if the Federal Government accepts new recommendations from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).\\nTelecommunications consultant Gavin Priestley says the ACCC has recommended a wholesale line rental of $7.00 a month for CBD customers, but $34 for major regional centres.\\nHe says that means rental costs for lines in smaller communities could rise much higher.\\n\"What it signals is the average of the access prices for telephones right across Australia is going to change and our worst fears potentially are going to be realised,\" he said.\\n\"That is country people will not get parity and will pay more for access to their phone line.\\n\"When the sale of Telstra was touted we were guaranteed that we would get parity of price and future proofing of the service.

outbreaks is being questioned, after a decision to withdraw financial support for Queensland\\'s attempts to control sugar cane smut.\\nThe fungal disease, sugar cane smut, was first discovered in south-east Queensland just over two months ago and since then more than 50 properties have been put under quarantine, disrupting harvest and putting strict protocols on local growers.\\nAs a signatory to the new Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed under Plant Health Australia, canegrowers were anticipating federal and state governments would pay 80 per cent of the $43 million emergency response plan.\\nBut the National Management Group (NMG) voted against the proposal, suggesting the disease could not be eradicated or contained.\\nIsis Canegrowers chairman Joe Russo says the decision has shocked the cane growing community.\\n\"It\\'s no different from when you\\'re told you first had smut, you\\'re somewhat quite gutted to hear the response to what NMG have come down with,\" he said.\\n\\nPolybag price increase hurts producers\\nThe price of the woven polybags used to package seed, wool and fertiliser is set to rise due to soaring crude oil prices.\\nThe bags are made from a petroleum-based resin, which has increased in price and is becoming harder to source from Asia.\\nBob Adams, from Colquhouns Fremantle Bag company says producers can no longer absorb the cost, and are now looking at other options.\\n\"We\\'ve seen costs rise by as much as 30 to 35 per cent over the last eight to nine months to the point it\\'s slowly being passed onto the packers and the users of the bags,\" he said.\\n\\nFinancial lifeline saves Broken Hill YMCA\\nThe Broken Hill YMCA will open within three months after being thrown a last minute lifeline.\\nThe building was going on the market because it was $50,000 short of funds but it has been given that amount by its governing body.\\nA team of YMCA Australia staff will be in the city next week to meet with the board and develop a business plan and a long term management strategy.\\nNew staff will be recruited and president Dionne Devlin says it still needs the ongoing support of the local community.\\n\"We start straight away looking at the capital works that need to be done down there and organising the people that want to help and getting straight in and getting things done,\" she said.\\n\\nRio Tinto plans Perth tyre retreading facility\\nMore evidence of the impact of the resources boom has surfaced today as miners see a worldwide shortage driving the price of mining tyres up to $100,000 each.\\nThe huge cost has prompted Rio Tinto to invest in its own tyre retreading facility in Perth, which will open later this year.\\nKevin McLeish, from the Rio-owned Argyle Diamonds, says the lengths they have had to go to shows the magnitude of the problem.\\n\"So here you have have a mining company getting into the tyre business, to be able to keep itself open,\" he said.\\n\\nFuture growth in agriculture depends on exports: ABARE\\nThe Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) says most of the future growth in Australian agriculture will depend on exports.\\nThe peak commodity forecaster has released a report showing agriculture\\'s contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen from around 3.6 per cent in the early 1980s to 2.7 per cent in the years leading up to 2005.\\nThat is mainly due to the growth in the services, mining and manufacturing sectors.\\nABARE spokeswoman Lisa Elliston says while agriculture continues to expand, it needs to focus on international markets because the domestic market is so small.\\n\"In particular that means that we have to focus on things like barriers to trade, so that we have tariffs and import quotas that continue to be an important issue,\" she said.\\n\\nAuthorities mull beef exports with Korea\\nTwo of Australia\\'s biggest beef exporters are meeting with Korean importers on the Gold Coast this week, to discuss ways Australia can sell more beef to the country.\\nKorea is Australia\\'s third-largest beef market, taking more than 100,000 tonnes last year, but US exports are set to resume after a two-year ban related to mad cow disease.\\nMeat and Livestock Australia regional manager for Korea, Glen Feist, says Korean supermarkets want more Australian beef and positive news is expected as early as tomorrow.\\n\"For the first time we\\'ve actually got two of Australia\\'s major exporters, two of Korea\\'s major importers and Tesco, which is the number two retailer up there with 44 hypermarkets, getting into a room for three days together,\" he said.\\n\\nTas apple producers seek new Japanese export protocol\\nTasmanian apple growers are pinning their hopes on a new export protocol to save their export market to Japan.\\nThe industry has spent eight years pioneering the trade, but despite years of research, the fumigation of fruit for codling moth has continued to cause significant internal fruit damage.\\nFruit exporter Ken Bell says the industry is not likely to resume the trade until a new protocol can be agreed to.\\n\"Generally, the industry feel a little bit despondent with the Japanese market because we\\'ve worked for years and years and it\\'s cost a lot of money as you say, a lot of heartache,\"he said.\\n\\nCall for community projects for work-for-the-dole participants\\nCommunity projects are being sought for work-for-the-dole programs in Broken Hill, Menindee and Wilcannia.\\nSureway Employment chief executive officer, Judy Galloway, says two projects are already under way in Broken Hill but more are needed.\\nShe says the projects are for not for profit organisations and provide an opportunity for people to gain skills that could lead to part time or full time employment.\\nMrs Galloway says participants can not take the place of paid employees.\\n\"So it has to be additional work which is something of a community benefit,\" she said.\\n\\nNSW irrigators consider class action over lost groundwater entitlements\\nIrrigators in New South Wales are considering legal action despite the Federal Government signing off on a $110 million package to compensate them for a loss of groundwater entitlements.\\nThe package relates to major cuts in bore water allocations in six river valleys, but the irrigators say the financial assistance is far too little, too late.\\nDennis Moxey from the Lachlan Groundwater Working Group says he understands their concerns, but doubts a class action would succeed.\\n\"It\\'s making some people fairly irate about the whole process now and I\\'m not sure we are going to be able to hold the irrigators to a negotiation process. They\\'re going to start taking their own actions,\" he said.\\n\\nSenate told Govt to blame for \\'environmental disaster\\' in Culgoa\\nA Senate inquiry into water has been told that successive Queensland governments have ignored the advice of expert scientists, to create what is possibly the \\'worst environmental disaster in inland Australia\\' on the Culgoa Balonne floodplain in northern New South Wales.\\nNSW farmer Ed Fessey told the Senate\\'s Rural and Regional Affairs Committee that over extraction of water in Queensland is destroying both the environment and the livelihoods of those on the Culgoa floodplain.\\n\"This is highlighted by the flippant, nonchalant and at times dismissive attitude that successive Queensland Natural Resources to due process; the complete ignorance of a very strong and detailed submission by the New South Wales Government in 2004; the very select use of Peter Cullen\\'s scientific report to endorse their plan, whilst ignoring the clear warnings that significant ecological problems will occur,\" he said.\\n\\nGrim outlook for SA grain harvest\\nA warm and windy day in South Australia yesterday has not helped what was looking set to be a decent season for grain growers.\\nThe grain harvest will now be well below average this year, unless there is significant rain in the next two weeks.\\nPeter Fulwood from Rural Solutions South Australia says the state is headed for its driest winter on record.\\n\"If we don\\'t get substantial rain in the next couple of weeks, we could be looking at one of, if not the driest, winters on record and then we go into our spring weather where temperatures can rapidly rise in those months and we can get drying winds, crops can come under extreme moisture stress,\" he said.\\n\"Overall, the state crop certainly won\\'t be anything above average unless we were to get a complete change in the weather. The estimates we would be looking at would be below average.\"\\nUnusual weather patterns in Australia and overseas are putting new pressure on global grain prices.\\nDry weather in Western Australia means grain handler CBH will not be exporting lupins this year, to ensure stock feed supplies into 2007.\\n\\nFarmers urged to assess greenhouse gas emissions\\nFarmers are being warned to start assessing their carbon emissions, even though a new state-based carbon trading scheme does not include agriculture yet.\\nStates including Victoria and New South Wales have launched a plan to establish emission targets and a trading scheme for electricity generators.\\nTracie Griffin from the Victorian Government\\'s Greenhouse in Agriculture Program says farmers are the second highest greenhouse gas polluters.\\n\\nClaim Mustard seed could supply biodiesel industry\\nThe mustard seed could be the next oilseed to supply the growing biodiesel industry.\\nIn South Australiam trials of the crop will be expanded, because it fares better in low rainfall regions that cannot support other oilseed crops like canola.\\nTrent Potter from the South Australian Research and Development Institute is hopeful more farmers will soon be able to produce oilseed crops for the biodiesel industry.\\n\\nWomen\\'s contribution to rural business in spotlight\\nIt is Regional Women in Business Week, and its founder says it is an important chance for country women to promote themselves.\\nQueensland author Jo Eady says businesswomen in rural and regional areas have a significant impact on local employment and incomes, and says it is no wonder the week has taken off around the country.\\n\"There\\'s retail, there\\'s industrial, there\\'s manufacturing, there\\'s agriculture, and then there\\'s the miriad of service industries which takes in you know your marketing and your promotion and your computer type activities or your technology type activities and we\\'re there,\" she said.\\n\\nSubmissions sought on chemical spray drift\\nThe Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is calling for submissions on its plan to reduce chemical spray drift on farms.\\nProducers, insurance companies and other farm industry representatives had their say on the proposals at a forum in Canberra yesterday.\\nThe authority\\'s David Loschke says the plan includes national regulations for labelling and handling pesticides.\\n\"There\\'s a range of approaches on existing labels, quite a bit of variability and that\\'s something we want to change,\" he said.\\n\"We want to bring them all into a much more uniform sort of approach and an approach that the states with their powers of enforcement can use effectively to control their uses.\"\\nSubmissions are due on October 6. \\n\\nScientists map DNA sequence for bovine animals\\nScientists have finished a five-year project to build a genetic map of bovine animals, which is expected to lead to better cattle production, breeding and disease control.\\nThe $70 million project to map the DNA sequence is a joint effort between Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States.\\nDr Chris Prideaux from the CSIRO says it is now time to apply the science.\\n\"Really this map will speed up the roll-out of things like genetic markers, such traits as meat tenderness [and] for marbling,\" he said.\\n\\nWinemakers pay tribute to Len Evans\\nOne of the great names of the Australian wine industry has died at the age of 75.\\nWine judge and writer Len Evans is credited with bringing Australian wines to prominence on the world stage, by encouraging a move away from fortified varieties into other blends.\\nIn 1968, Mr Evans founded the Rothbury Estate in the Hunter Valley with Murray Tyrrell.\\nMr Tyrrell\\'s son, Bruce, says his father\\'s friend was instrumental in building Australia\\'s wine export industry.\\n\"He was certainly a very important cog in what wheel, there\\'s no question or doubt about that,\" he said.\\n\"Len was a larger than life personality, and he was one of those people that no door was ever locked to, because if it was, he just opened it and walked through it.\\n\\nFed Govt to contribute to wetlands restoration in NSW\\nThe Federal Government will help to fund works to restore two major wetlands in New South Wales.\\n\\nRural women\\'s isolation a key topic in youth survey\\nThe isolation of women has emerged as a big issue in a national survey of youth in rural Australia this week.\\nWorkshops are being held in five states as part of the Year of the Outback, to identify key issues and find some answers.\\nCoordinator Fiona Campbell-Maybury, says women want some kind of network to help them get access to resources.\\n\"They are not necessarily suggesting that the resources are not there, what they\\'re suggesting is that they\\'re not necessarily aware of them,\" she said.\\n\\nWave Hill walk-off celebrations under way\\nIt has been 40 years since the Wave Hill walk-off, a protest which led to the Indigenous rights movement in Australia.\\nCelebrations have begun in the remote Northern Territory of Kalkaringi, 800km south-west of Darwin.\\nAn overwhelming mood of friendship and reconciliation binds more than 1,500 people gathered by the Victoria River, the site where stockman Vincent Lingiari led his people on strike in 1966.\\nOriginally protesting against the pay conditions on nearby Wave Hill Station, the nine-year strike soon became a battle for land rights.\\nAmong the crowd today were descendants of the original Gurindgi strikers, pastoralists, politicians and visitors from across the country.\\nAs part of the festival an agreement is being signed between the Northern Territory Cattlemen\\'s Association, the Northern Territory Government, the Land Councils and the Indigenous Land Corporation to boost Aboriginal participation in the pastoral industry.\\n\\nNZ stone fruit growers get WA access\\nNew Zealand stone fruit growers will be allowed to sell their fruit into markets in Western Australia, six years after applying for access.\\nBiosecurity Australia has made the decision in a risk import analysis, as long as fruit is fumigated and inspected to keep pests out of WA.\\nPeter Gubler from the WA Summerfruit Council says he is concerned, but does not expect imports to have a major impact, in a market where prices are already lower than in the eastern states.\\n\"Money wise, the commodities like peaches and nectarines, I don\\'t think they\\'ll benefit from that because of the low return that growers here in the state get anyway,\" he said.\\n\\nApple, pear industry unveils competitiveness plan\\nThe apple and pear industry has launched an ambitious research program to make Australian orchards globally competitive.\\nThe million-dollar program, Future Orchards 2012, was unveiled in Hobart this morning.\\nYears of rising production costs and low prices have left Australian apple and pear growers fighting for survival.\\nThe industry has to reduce costs while increasing the amount of fruit harvested per hectare, and Future Orchards 2012 should prove it can be done.\\nThe current yield is 20 tonnes of fruit per hectare from an average of 640 trees.\\nUnder the plan tonnage would more than doubled and high density planting would almost triple the amount of trees.\\nThe intensive orcharding would also be capital intensive, costing up to $60,000 a hectare.\\n\\nLabor\\'s ethanol pledge gets mixed response\\nThere has been a mixed response in Queensland to Labor\\'s election promise to make all petrol include 5 per cent ethanol.\\nPremier Peter Beattie says the mandate would increase to 10 per cent after 2010.\\nThe Premier says the 5 per cent mandate will increase the use of ethanol 20-fold, to over 200 million litres, in a year.\\nThe Opposition says it was their policy five years ago.\\nGrain growers on the Darling Downs say it is good news, as they have plans to build an ethanol plant at Dalby which will consume 400,000 tonnes of sorghum and produce 160 million litres.\\nThe petrol companies Caltex and BP are less supportive of a mandate and the RACQ says there is no evidence that ethanol blends are being sold at prices below normal petrol.\\n\\nRed wine fails to meet Chinese standards\\nChina has rejected more than 10,000 bottles of Australian red wine because it contains too much of the preservative sulphur dioxide.\\nThe 840 cartons were rejected by Chinese customs authorities at the port of Shenzhen.\\nIt is understood the wine was bottled in 2003 by a winemaker from New South Wales, whose name is being kept under wraps.\\nAustralian Wine and Brandy Corporation chief executive Sam Tolley says the wine has been knocked back because it does not meet Chinese standards.\\n\"So when the sulphur was added to the wine, the blend wasn\\'t mixed thoroughly, so there\\'s some parts of the wine that have this high sulphur content and the rest would have lower,\" he said.\\n\\nLamb industry thrives despite drought\\nAlthough the prime lamb industry is in its fifth year of severe drought, the number of new season lambs coming into the market is expected to rise another 3 per cent in the next 12 months.\\nMeat and Livestock Australia says that is due to a 16 per cent jump in second-cross lambs, which are produced for meat.\\nAnd there has been a dramatic fall in the price of cattle contracts on the Sydney Futures Exchange.\\n\\nFarmers predict crop failure within weeks\\nFarmers in Victoria\\'s Wimmera Mallee grain growing region say if it does not rain within two weeks their crops will fail.\\nThe effects of a lack of rain have been made worse by a run of frosts and strong drying winds.\\nNeil Simpson who has planted 1,500 hectares of wheat at Berriwillock in the southern Mallee says the earlier sown crop is already dying and it is looking bleak for the rest.\\n\"Assuming that there isn\\'t further rain, the late crops will also fail and they may not even produce a head in the circumstances so the outlook is certainly very dismal at this point and continuing to deteriorate,\" he said.\\n\\nNickel shortage causes panic\\nThe London Metal Exchange was forced to intervene in the nickel market last night for the first time since the 1980s, to curb panic buying among metal traders.\\nAnalysts predict there is only enough nickel left on the exchange to cover one day of world consumption.\\nSupplies have shrunk because of a strike at the world\\'s largest nickel mine at Voisey\\'s Bay in Canada.\\nIn Australia, shares in nickel mining companies have skyrocketed, as speculators predict the situation will not ease in the short term.\\nCommonwealth Bank commodity strategist Tobin Gorey predicts the market tightness will continue to force up prices.\\n\"In terms of supply being tight yes it will [force prices up]. Whether it is actually so tight that people can\\'t complete transactions is another matter, that\\'s really what defines the current circumstance,\" he said.\\n\\nPlan aims to tackle climate change impact on agriculture\\nThe federal, state and territory governments have unveiled a national action plan to tackle the affects of climate change on agriculture.\\nIt is designed to help farmers adapt to a changing climate, mitigate and prevent the impact of change, provide better research and development and increase awareness.\\nWhile there is no funding or specific projects yet, Ben Fargher from the National Farmers Federation says it is a significant step.\\n\\nAustralia on track for driest August on record\\nThe National Climate Centre says we could be shaping up for another major drought year if it does not rain soon.\\nAustralia is on track for its driest August on record, with an average of just 2.6 millimetres of rain so far this month, compared to the lowest recorded total of 7.1 millimetres.\\nMeteorologist Blair Trewin says while south-west WA is in trouble, the eastern states are in a slightly better position because of rain last month.\\n\"[It] certainly hasn\\'t been as dry as years like 1994 and 2002 generally speaking,\" he aid.\\n\"If we were to have a very dry September/October period then we might start getting down into the kind of territory we saw in 1994 and 2002, but our outlook is not currently indicating a particularly high chance of that happening.\"\\n\\nGrowers fear Coles Myer takeover\\nFruit and vegetable growers are concerned a foreign takeover of Coles Myer could squeeze them out of the market.\\nA US-based consortium has launched a bid to buy the retail giant.\\nMichael Badcock, from AUSVEG, fears a sale would leave producers at the whim of major international corporations.\\n\"The biggest problem we\\'ve got in Australia is that we have two major supermarket chains and that\\'s it, who control about 70 per cent of Australia\\'s market,\" he said.\\n\"If one of these is taken over by a big world player - and they\\'re quite ruthless in the way they cut costs and cut staff and everything else - if one does it the other one would do it.\\n\"That would be a disaster for producers in Australia.\"\\nThe Federal Government can reject takeovers that are deemed not to be in the national interest.\\nBut Griffith University\\'s Tony Makin says even with lobbying, farmers are unlikely to stop a takeover bid.\\n\\nGE rice contaminates US crop\\nThe US agriculture secretary says US supplies of long-grain rice are contaminated with a genetically-engineered variety which has not been approved for human use.\\nMike Johanns has announced that Bayer CropScience of Germany has told the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the US Food and Drug Administration that the experimental rice poses no threat to humans or the environment.\\nBut Mr Johanns does not know where the contaminated rice was found, how widespread it is, or how it entered the food supply.\\nAs for US customers, Mr Johanns says he is \"are providing information to my colleagues\".\\n\"I\\'m talking to them. I have indicated to them that we will provide whatever information they need,\" he said.\\nTesting kits will be supplied if required and USDA will investigate.\\n\\nCourt to rule on wallaby cull\\nPlans to cull wallabies on the two biggest islands in Bass Strait are being challenged in the Federal Administrative Appeals Tribunal.\\nThe Wildlife Protection Association of Australia wants to stop approved federal management plans, which allow farmers to shoot and export wallabies on King and Flinders islands.\\nPresident Pat O\\'Brien alleges the plan allows inhumane killing of joeys, breaches the national rifle code and misjudges the size of the wallaby population.\\nHe hopes the case will reveal critical information.\\n\"In the last appeal we had in New South Wales we found out that both Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland had overshot their quotas by about 15,000 animals,\" he said.\\n\"But they wouldn\\'t tell us unless we sort of had them in court and had them on oath.\\n\\nLand Rights Act changes please fishermen\\nLand rights claims over some inter-tidal areas on the Northern Territory coastline will be automatically terminated by changes to the federal Land Rights Act.\\nThe move affects claims won more than three years ago through the High Court and has been labelled \"un-Australian\" by the Northern Land Council.\\nBut Iain Smith, from the Territory\\'s Seafood Council, has welcomed the changes.\\nHe says some claims had big ramifications.\\n\"If at some future stage a court decided that while water was over Aboriginal land the water and the animals in it belonged to the relevant land trust - it was freehold title - then of course we would be totally excluded from the area unless we paid a fee,\" he said.\\n\\nTurnbull urges private water infrastructure investment\\nThere is a call today for more private investment to help solve the nation\\'s water shortages and fix ailing infrastructure.\\nThe federal Parliamentary Secretary for Water, Malcolm Turnbull, has released a discussion paper which includes a national set of guidelines for working with the private sector.\\nHe admits there have been problems with partnerships between the public and private arenas, but says there are major opportunities.\\n\"I don\\'t think many people would support, for example, privatising catchment management authorities or privatising dams or the sources of water,\" he said.\\n\\nRival bids leave Sedimentary\\'s future uncertain\\nThe future of a gold miner with exploration interests at Foster and Walhalla in Victoria remains uncertain, with shareholders offered both a merger and a takeover bid.\\nSedimentary complained to the National Takeovers Panel last week that there were unacceptable circumstances around a takeover bid by Auselect.\\nNow Sedimentary has announced a merger agreement with Premier Gold Mines.\\nThe takeovers panel has decided it will not pursue Sedimentary\\'s complaint about the takeover bid.\\n\\nEthanol plant construction under way\\nWork on Australia\\'s first purpose-built ethanol plant is starting in north-west Victoria today.\\nAustralian Ethanol plans to produce 100 million litres of ethanol annually at the Swan Hill plant, which is due to be completed late next year.\\nChief executive Peter Anderton says local farmers will supply it with 350,000 tonnes of grain and corn.\\n\"Corn would provide about a third of the grain required and then the remainder we would source off winter crops, wheat and barley,\" he said.\\n\\n116-turbine wind farm approved\\nThe Victorian Government has approved the construction of one of Australia\\'s biggest wind farms.\\nThe 116-turbine wind farm will be built at Mount Gellibrand in the state\\'s south-west.\\nDespite political wrangling over the future of wind farms in Victoria, Colac Otway Shire Mayor Warren Riches says this project is likely to go ahead.\\n\"I would think this is one project which will almost certainly go ahead no matter which party is in power after November,\" he said.\\n\"It is in an open windswept area.\\n\"It\\'s not something, for instance, that\\'s on the cliffs of views overlooking the Great Ocean Road or the ocean or anything like that.\\n\\nRabbit infestation hits SA crops\\nThe worst infestation of rabbits in 10 years has caused tens of thousands of dollars of damage to crops and pastures on the lower Eyre Peninsula in South Australia.\\nEarly rains and green grass are being blamed for the high breeding numbers, and neither calicivirus nor myxomatosis are having an impact.\\nAndrew Ware, from Lipson, says his farm has been hit hard.\\n\"Just driving into our property at night-time, usually you wouldn\\'t see any rabbits but at the moment we\\'re seeing five or six just at the entrance to our property,\" he said.\\n\"I reckon we would have lost perhaps 25 acres of crop.\\n\\nLeaf rust let loose on feral blackberries\\nThe CSIRO is stepping up efforts to stop the spread of feral blackberries using strains of the fungus, leaf rust.\\nThe scientific body wants farmers to test the fungus on blackberry infestations over the next three years.\\nSmall-scale testing was done in 2004, and the Federal Government has now boosted funding to roll out the project across the country.\\n\\nGates to fund agricultural research\\nAgricultural research and development in developing countries is set for a big boost from the world\\'s richest man.\\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is extending a program which currently supports research and development in the health sector.\\nAgricultural economist Professor Phil Pardey, from the University of Minnesota, says the funding should make a big difference.\\n\"They\\'ve been looking to broaden out in other areas and so they\\'ve made an in-principle decision to start ramping up investments into agricultural research,\" he said.\\n\"The orders of magnitude of sums of money that I\\'ve heard

review under way into the tax arrangements for forestry managed investment schemes, labelled by some as the drivers of plantation expansion.\\n\\nAmcor blames external factors for profit woes\\nAustralia\\'s second-largest cardboard manufacturer is blaming cyclone Larry, high fuel prices and a shift by the major supermarkets into plastic crates for a big fall in profits.\\nAmcor\\'s Australian division has reported a 20 per cent profit plunge, down $54 million to $262 million, mainly due to falling cardboard sales.\\nBut spokesman Paul Ward says the horticulture sector should not expect a big jump in packaging prices as a result.\\n\"Price increases that may go through will purely relate to inputs that we have no control over,\" he said.\\n\"Everyone knows about the fuel costs that severely impacts businesses like ourselves.\\n\\nOxiana to expand Prominent Hill mine\\nOxiana Limited says it will spend $775 million developing the Prominent Hill copper gold mine in South

has pushed back the start date.\\nChairman Denis Waddell says after all the delays, they will be taking advantage of the good gold price.\\n\"We\\'ll be selling it, we\\'ve got a fair bit of expenditure at the moment, so we\\'re not in the position at the moment were we can punt on where the gold price is going,\" he said\\n\\nStanton urges HGP declaration on beef\\nNutritionist Rosemary Stanton is calling for better meat labelling that tells consumers whether Hormone Growth Promotants (HGPs) have been used in producing beef.\\nThe Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority believes promotants are used to produce 40 per cent of all beef produced in Australia.\\nWith a ban on HGPs in the European Union, Ms Stanton says shoppers here should be told about the history of the meat they are buying.\\n\"There are two ways you could do this,\" she said.\\n\"You could just simply label the beef that comes from animals that don\\'t have HGPs, so that it could be no HGPs used in the production of this meat, or the second way would be that you could say that they have been used.\"\\n\\nMLA poll rigging concerns Cattle Council\\nThe Cattle Council has expressed concern over the

conference in Tasmania this week is looking at whether rural and coastal communities can continue to cope with an influx of city residents.\\nThe 10th Sustainable Regional Economic Growth Conference has heard that the seachange and treechange trend has had mixed results.\\nDr Geoff Cockfield, from the University of Southern Queensland, says city residents moving in with higher incomes and new skills, are now being hit by soaring fuel prices.\\n\"Certainly that\\'s going to limit some thought of commuting great distances,\" he said.\\n\"On the other hand there is a possible upside to that, because high fuel prices might mean that we don\\'t transport things in, people don\\'t shop out quite as much.\\n\\nAquaculture conference delegates descend on Adelaide\\nAdelaide is hosting the world\\'s largest aquaculture conference over the next three days.\\nMore than 1,000 delegates from around the world are attending Skretting Australasian Aquaculture.\\nThe theme is innovation,

Australia.\\nBiosecurity Australia has approved an application to import mangoes under strict regulations, including vapour heat treatment of the fruit before they leave Taiwan.\\nTrevor Dunmall, from the Australian Mango Industry Association, says there will only be a narrow window for the fruit to compete with the homegrown product.\\n\"The Taiwanese season\\'s basically counter-seasonal to the Australian season although there could be some overlap in their season with our early season mangoes,\" he said.\\n\\nWestern growers experiment with summer crops\\nWhile crops in the west are usually grown in the winter months and harvested in the summer months, this year is a bit topsy-turvy.\\nSome growers are experimenting with summer crops like millet and sorghum to provide more feed for livestock.\\nConsultant Simon Teakle says seed is relatively cheap and the crops could be a good option for growers struggling through a dry season.\\n\"People have obviously, at the moment, got a shortage of stock feed,\" he said.\\n\"The type of carrying capacity that forage sorghum and forage millet has is quite large, because of the amount of growth that they get, provided they get sub-soil moisture in there.\\n\\nCentral Qld farmers predict bumper harvest\\nThe wheat harvest has started in central Queensland, where growers are expecting a bumper 500,000 tonne harvest.\\nThe latest forecast from the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics predicts an 11 per cent drop from last year\\'s near-record harvest of 40.5 million tonnes nationwide.\\nConsultant Pat McKee says it is the first time since the 2000 winter season that central Queensland farmers look like they will have an above-average crop.\\n\"I think that even with the warm finish that the crops, particularly north of Emerald and north of Capella, will be quite good as far as quality is concerned,\" he said.\\n\\nHorticulture code delays anger growers\\nFruit and vegetable growers are becoming increasingly angry at delays to their promised code of conduct.\\nTwo years ago the Federal Government pledged a mandatory code to improve transparency between growers and wholesalers.\\nA group of north Queensland growers issued an ultimatum last week in an attempt to force the Government to confirm whether the code will be mandatory or voluntary.\\nAtherton Tablelands fruit grower Scott Dixson says it is a disgrace that the deadline has passed and they still have not heard from the Government.\\n\"You tell me what other business sends away their total annual production to a third-party not knowing what financial return they will receive and no legal right of documented evidence of what it in fact sold for?\" he said.\\n\"The New South Wales Farmers Association have already gone to press over this issue and they have actually accused the Government of holding it up, surely because of the Queensland election.\"\\nQueensland Nationals Senator Ron Boswell says he understands growers\\' frustrations, but he cannot make any promises.\\n\\nFarmer confidence hits 4-year low: survey\\nFarmer confidence levels have slumped to a four-year low, according to the latest quarterly survey by Rabobank.\\nA lack of winter rain has caused farmers in most states to be more pessimistic about their outlook, with the biggest fall in confidence in Western Australia, closely followed by Victoria and South Australia.\\nPeter Knobblanche says cereal croppers and dairy farmers are the most concerned, followed by beef, sheep, wool and lamb producers.\\n\"It was last this bad in 2002 when we had

living on irrigation properties.\\nIrrigators instigated the survey across more than 1 million hectares of the Murray River catchment.\\nAlbury-based ecologist Matthew Herring says the findings dispel the perception that farming is bad for the environment.\\n\"There was some really exciting species found like the little gilberts whistler that you get in red gum areas where there\\'s a dense understorey,\" he said.\\n\\nStripe rust found in NSW, SA wheat crops\\nThe fungal disease, stripe rust, has been discovered in wheat crops in northern New South Wales and South Australia for the first time this year.\\nThe highly contagious disease, which can cut crop yields by up to 50 per cent, has been found between Moree and Narrabri, and on the Yorke Peninsual.\\nDr Gordon Murray, from the Department of Primary Industries in New South Wales, says the disease could spread.\\nHe says growers with low yields need to decide whether it is worth using fungicides.\\n\"With the generally dry conditions that will tend to slow the amount of stripe rust but it will also mean that the damage it does will be much less,\" he said.\\n\"Dryland crops are unlikely to benefit from spraying unless we get a turnaround in the season and a lot more rain.\"\\nStripe rust is found on the leaf of wheat plants, in the form of yellow stripes or spores.\\n\\nHigh temperatures mark Dowerin field day\\nAn unusually warm day has marked the start of Western Australia\\'s largest field days in the Wheatbelt town of Dowerin.\\nToday\\'s expected top of around 27 degrees seems to reflect the strange season being endured by many farmers this year.\\nBut as Jane Grieve reports, big crowds are still expected.\\n\"Out of the car window on the way to Dowerin, two hours north east of Perth, crops are patchy and stock feed marginal.\\n\"Machinery sales could be affected this year, with many farmers not anticipating a good harvest.\\n\\nTraditional owners decry mine expansion approval\\nEnvironmental approval has been granted for the expansion of the McArthur River Mine in the Gulf of Carpentaria.\\nThe conversion of the zinc and lead mine to open-cut involves moving the McArthur River five kilometres.\\nDespite the green light and the promise of a substantial environmental management bond, local traditional owners still oppose the move.\\nSpokesman Jack Green says talk of local training programs is not enough.\\n\"It\\'s the main river ... we [have] culture and ceremony and sacred site tied up on that river,\" he said.\\n\"If they\\'re going to change it and that\\'s going to really make us upset, really worried about it.\\n\"It\\'s going to bugger up the song line, the dreaming line you know.\\n\"It\\'s bad enough already.\"\\n\\nATV industry working on safety standards\\nMotorcycle companies say they are creating a national safety standard for four-wheel all-terrain bikes.\\nThere have been concerns for some years about the number of crashes involving all-terrain vehicles (ATVs).\\nThe New South Wales Coroner is investigating the latest, the death of a 55-year-old rider on a farm on the Monaro in New South Wales.\\nYamaha safety lawyer Kelly Stallard says the industry is working on standards, a code of practice, and educating riders.\\n\"The ATV industry is very concerned with occupational health and safety issues,\" she said.\\n\"We are finalising an industry code of practice for users, particularly farmers, on the safe use of these machines.\\n\\nHeifer exports may hurt dairy industry: Perkins\\nWith the ongoing dry weather conditions, exports of dairy heifers might help to save farmers.\\nBut one industry leader is worried about the long-term impact on the Australian herd.\\nTurkey is the latest country to inquire about Australian livestock, as it looks to set up its own breeding herd.\\nBut Michael Perkins, from the Holstien-Fresian Association, says milk companies need to offer farmers better prices, to stop Australia\\'s best livestock disappearing overseas.\\n\"If milk prices do go down like the indication is at the moment - there\\'s a 2 to 5 per cent drop in the commodity price - then we could be looking at a lot of heifers leaving this country,\" he said.\\n\"That would be sad for the industry long-term.\\n\\nFarmers to vote on Dairy Australia levy\\nDairy farmers will vote for the first time early next year on how much they should pay to peak body Dairy Australia.\\nProducers currently pay a levy of one-third of a cent per litre to fund research and development, marketing and trade issues.\\nThe levy totals $32 million a year.\\nDairy Australia\\'s John McKew says the levy will have to increase just to maintain current work.\\n\"They have to start thinking about it now,\" he said.\\n\"As their national services body Dairy Australia, how are we going to fund the services that we currently have which are imperative for the industry, but also what are we going to do about the issues which are on our doorstep or on the cusp of it, issues that we need to manage as an industry moving forward?.\\n\\nDrought blamed for cattle indicator drop\\nA lack of rain is being blamed for the biggest weekly fall in the Eastern Young Cattle Indicator since April last year.\\nThe indicator of prices from saleyards in the eastern states is considered a guide to general price trends.\\nIt fell 14 cents last week and is hovering around $3.60, compared to $4.00 at the same time last year.\\nPeter Weeks, from Meat and Livestock Australia, says if it does not rain the market could fall by up to 60 cents a kilo.\\n\"Certainly without widespread rain in the next four to six weeks, I think we will see prices fall back further,\" he said.\\n\"They will gradually decline moving into late this year and early next year, simply because demand is coming back on export markets and we\\'ve got the spring supply about to come on.\"\\nIn the south-west of Western Australia a surge of dairy herds on to the market has caused the price of cows to fall $150 per head.\\nWith low demand locally, dairy farmers from the east are buying cows, trucking them across the Nullarbor, and still saving between $100 and $200 per head.\\nLivestock agent Karl Harnett says with more WA farmers leaving the industry, there is a big gap for the eastern states to capitalise on.\\n\"Basically right across the eastern seaboard over the last 12 months there has been a shortage of dairy cattle, especially quality dairy cattle,\" he said.\\n\"Within in the last six months we\\'ve probably seen around 700 to 800 dairy cattle that have moved across the border.\\n\\nAdvertising funds to help stonefruit growers\\nThe Federal Government has announced a one-off $1 million grant to help stonefruit growers who cannot sell fruit to Taiwan this year.\\nGrowers have been locked out of the export market due to new fruit fly protocols.\\n\\nMcGauran leans toward voluntary horticulture code\\nThere are growing signs the horticulture industry will have to be satisfied with a voluntary code of conduct.\\nThe Federal Government originally pledged a mandatory code to give fruit and vegetable producers more negotiating power in the market place.\\nBut Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says a voluntary code is now being given serious consideration, although no final decision has been made.\\n\"One thing we want to avoid by way of a mandatory code is polarisation of the industry,\" he said.\\n\"You need the whole of supply chain in horticulture working together as we face the pressure of cheap imports and a voluntary code of conduct may very well serve to bring industry closer together for mutual benefit.\\n\\nAWB plays down Cole inquiry to growers\\nWheat exporter AWB has told Victorian grain growers it does not think the Cole inquiry into allegations of sanction-breaking kickbacks will present any problems for the company.\\nAWB\\'s Brendan Stewart and Ian Donges have also told a grain growers\\' meeting in Melbourne that they believe the company will be in a position to rebuild after the inquiry.\\nThe Victorian Farmers Federation grains group president, Ian Hastings, says he believes AWB has asked for similar meetings with farmer groups in other states.\\n\"Brendan Stewart spoke about how the Cole inquiry was progressing and the fact that AWB still were clearly of the belief that they have not really done anything wrong,\" he said.\\n\"They expect at the end of the Cole inquiry that [they] should be able to start and rebuild the company.\\n\"They don\\'t believe that they have actually broken any laws so I guess we all need to wait and see.\"\\nAWB spokesman Peter McBride says the company does not want to make any public statement pre-empting the outcome of the Cole inquiry.\\n\\nClean Seas eyes onshore tuna breeding success\\nSouth Australian company Clean Seas believes it might be only a year away from becoming the first to crack the secret of breeding tuna onshore.\\nThe problem lies in trying to replicate breeding conditions in the wild, where tuna travel vast distances to find warm water to spawn.\\nMarine biotechnologist Abigail Elizur says the company is drawing on knowledge from around the world to try to speed up the process.\\n\"I hope that by the end of the year or the start or the beginning of 2007 we will already have spawning and we certainly will try and apply all the previous knowledge,\" she said.\\n\\nIsolated growers ship fruit to Europe\\nMango growers in Katherine and Kununurra in far north Western Australia are setting up a company to sell fruit directly to European markets.\\nTrials of sending fruit to Europe via sea freight have until now been heavily financed by government and industry.\\nThe success of those trials has led to the new venture.\\nExecutive officer Jill Parker is confident it will work, despite difficult market conditions in recent years.\\n\"Not a lot of prospects on exports for this area other than getting this sea freight to work,\" she said.\\n\"It\\'s been difficult for them to be able to justify to spending this sort of money that\\'s needed to to get this off the ground.\\n\\nBull sale may have set records\\nLivestock agents believe a charolais bull sale in southern Queensland has set an Australian record.\\nDespite the drought, 188

body has worked with the RSPCA and Animals Australia to develop an animal welfare kit.\\nSpokeswoman Brigid Peachey says the kit discusses contentious issues, including the handling of bobby calves, dehorning and tail docking.\\n\"What the kit\\'s about is to let farmers know that they\\'re doing on farm is already good animal welfare in terms of on-farm husbandry,\" she said.\\n\"What we are hoping it\\'s doing is giving them the words to go out there, and talk to people about animal welfare and what they are doing in terms of just their good on farm practices.\\n\\nCattle Council, RSPCA talk welfare\\nIn a new approach to addressing animal welfare issues, the Cattle Council has held talks with the RSPCA for the first time.\\nThe meeting is part of an animal welfare roundtable at the Cattle Council\\'s executive meeting in Hobart.\\nPresident Bill Bray says the livestock industry can improve its image by working with groups which are trusted by the public.\\n\"RSPCA does have that respect, they have some views that are contrary to ours but we have to engage them and we have to get smarter at how we engage them and engage the community,\" he said.\\n\\nSA wool growers oppose AWI levy increase\\nWool growers in southern South Australia say they will not support a push to increase the levy they pay to the peak body, Australian Wool Innovation (AWI).\\nA report released this week says AWI has returned $417 million in benefits to the wool industry.\\nBut growers say they will not vote to increase the levy above the current rate of 2 per cent in this year\\'s wool poll.\\nTony Hedges, from Keith, does not think growers should pay anything.\\n\"What have they done for us?\" he said.\\n\"What they\\'re doing now is the repeat of what they did 20 years ago, and what happened 20 years ago was the repeat of what they did 20 years before.\\n\"I don\\'t think they need any more money, I think they squander what money they\\'ve got there now.\\n\"They\\'ve had their chances and they\\'ve blown it, I think.\"\\nTrevor Little, from Kongorong, says growers have seen little output from the AWI.\\n\"The money that\\'s been achieved over the years, and many years of the levy on the wool has not really in the last 10 years achieved anything,\" he said.\\nMalcolm McDonald, from Willalooka Pastoral Company, added: \"I don\\'t think, from a promotional point of view, that it\\'s been spent wisely.\\n\\nWoolgrowers revise PETA case claim\\nThere has been a new development in the ongoing Federal Court case between Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) and animal rights group PETA.\\nThe 103 woolgrowers supporting the action will now no longer allege that they have suffered a direct economic loss as a result of a PETA campaign.\\nThe case centres on allegations that PETA\\'s actions have reduced sales of wool by spreading negative publicity and misinformation about the wool industry and the practice of mulesing.\\nLes Targ, from AWI, says the growers are still involved in other parts of the class action.\\n\"What is happening is that those 103 woolgrowers are no longer claiming direct economic loss because of the difficulties of proving that,\" he said.\\n\"You\\'ve got to remember that they say goodbye to their wool at the farm gate and there\\'s about six different owners between them and the retailer that sells the finished product.\\n\\nNLIS poll hacking probe continues\\nAn independent review into tampering with an Internet poll on the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is expected within the next

cost growers\\nThe wheat export regulator has confirmed that growers could face losses, because of a confidential clause in a contract between the corporate and export arms of AWB.\\nIf the grain handler loses its export monopoly after the oil-for-food Inquiry, AWB Limited could claim damages from the national wheat pool.\\nThe pool is run by AWB International and pays growers for their grain.\\nThe Wheat Export Authority says it has a number of concerns about the contract, which is now being re-negotiated as part of an AWB restructure.\\nBut AWB International chairman Ian Donges denies damages could run to tens of millions of dollars.\\n\"It\\'s a three-year agreement so if you break the agreement in the first year it would be greater than in the last year of the agreement but we are only talking in the end of the day many small numbers of millions of dollars if anything,\" he said.\\n\"There has been no problems between the two companies in terms of the way this contract has been performing - at AWB International, we have been extremely pleased with the performance of AWB Limited.\\n\"Speculation there is going to be a break in the contract is purely that.\"\\nMr Donges\\' comments have not reassured the Grains Council of Australia.\\nChairman Murray Jones says growers should not be paying for the fee at all and wants AWB to make the service agreement public immediately.\\n\"There shouldn\\'t be a fee that goes back to growers for a separation fee and if there is a break fee then we really need to know what it is,\" he said.\\n\"We are really calling on AWB to tell us what the service agreement contains, tell us what the break fees may be and any liabilities that the growers may take on.\"\\n\\nFormer AWB executive disputes colleague\\'s evidence\\nA former AWB executive has denied to the Cole inquiry that he hatched a plan with the Iraqi Grains Board in October 2000 to set up a scheme through which trucking fees would be paid.\\nAWB\\'s former general manager for marketing, Charles Stott, has told the hearing he rejects evidence given last week by his former colleague, Dominic Hogan.\\nSenior counsel assisting the inquiry, John Agius QC, went straight to an October 2000 series of handwritten notes and letters involving a meeting with Mr Hogan, Mr Stott and the Iraqi Minister for Trade.\\nMr Stott refuted Mr Hogan\\'s claim that he had anything to do with the establishment of an incentives scheme through which trucking fees would be paid.\\nMr Agius then asked Mr Stott if he was suggesting that Mr Hogan\\'s notes were made up.\\nMr Stott then replied: \"I have absolutely no idea.\\n\"I don\\'t know where they were drafted, I\\'m not even sure he took notes.\"\\n\\nVictorian ram takes out Supreme Merino title\\nA superfine ram from Victoria has taken out one of the wool industry\\'s most prestigious awards.\\nChampion rams from five states competed for the Supreme Merino Ram title last

overseas retailers asking about the environmental credentials of their suppliers.\\nSeventy per cent of the nation\\'s wine grape crush is already signed up to a stewardship program which documents good environmental practices.\\nAmy Russell, from the Winemakers Federation, says retailers in the United Kingdom in particular are concerned about water use, waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\"There\\'s certainly increasing pressure out there from non-government organisations and even from some retailers to actually prove any claims that you may have,\" she said.\\n\"We do have that inherent position of being clean and green and it\\'s not just in the wine industry it\\'s in many industries.\\n\\nSA bushfire season may start early\\nSouth Australia\\'s bushfire season could be brought forward because of the threat posed by the predicted hot dry summer.\\nDeputy chief officer Andrew Lawson, from the Country Fire Service, says the lack of winter rain has also raised the fire threat.\\nThe state\\'s bushfire season usually starts on the Eyre Peninsula on November 1.\\nBut Mr Lawson says but it could begin weeks earlier.\\n\"We\\'re very concerned about the lack of rain over winter and that will lead to the forest fuels being drier a lot earlier,\" he said.\\n\\nSunbeam Foods back in the black\\nAustralia\\'s biggest dried fruit processing company has recorded a

Wodonga meatworks is located within the Wodonga city boundary.\\nThe local council has now announced a feasibility study into moving it to a location well away from populated areas.\\nLast month the Victorian Department of Human Services revealed four people in Wodonga had Q-fever.\\nIt named one possible cause as dust from holding yards at the abattoir.\\nNone had direct contact with livestock, the usual transmitter of the disease.\\nThe meatworks is owned by Norvic Food Processing.\\nThe company\\'s general manager, John Hayes, acknowledged that eventually the abattoir will have to be relocated.\\n\\nCole inquiry awaits documents ruling\\nThe oil-for-food inquiry into allegations AWB paid $300 million in kickbacks to the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein has been adjourned to a date to be fixed.\\nThe inquiry is now waiting for the Federal Court to decide if hundreds of secret AWB documents can be examined by Commissioner Terence Cole.\\n\\nRail price dispute may see grain trucked\\nAWB and GrainCorp say all Queensland grain could have to be transported by road in future because they have not been able to strike a deal on freight rates with Queensland Rail.\\nThe rail company says there has been a verbal agreement for a 12 per cent average increase in freight rates.\\nBut Lachlan Benson, from AWB, says there is no deal and the proposed increases of between 10 and 20 per cent are concerning.\\n\\'\\'The proposed rates put forward raise serious concerns with us as to whether rail remains a viable option for growers to export their grain,\" he said.\\n\"What that actually might mean for the rail network ... [is] you are going to see a large percentage of the harvest transferring to road.\"\\n\\nExpert urges stronger water rules\\nThe rights of farmers and rural and regional communities to have access to water is expected to cause legal battles in the future.\\nA water policy expert believes state governments need to improve the legal framework for water, as new pipelines are built to solve water shortages in the cities.\\nProfessor Jennifer McKay, from the University of South Australia, says there many issues with piping water from one region to another.\\n\"Because we\\'re now entering the era where we will be cross-sharing water between different watersheds,\" she said.\\n\"This will bring up the issue of payments and intersectoral conflicts.\\n\\nGoulburn Murray water diversion \\'not fair\\'\\nFarmers are dismayed at the Victorian Government\\'s plan to divert water away from the Goulburn Murray irrigation district to supply two regional cities.\\nThe State Government is building a pipeline from the Waranga Basin to Bendigo, and now wants to extend it as far as Ballarat.\\nBut Simon Ramsey says it is not fair on dairy farmers and fruit growers, who will only receive 7 per cent of the water allocations this season.\\n\"It\\'s disappointing given the angst and apprehension in the rural community about the present prolonged dry conditions and also obviously the very little allocations particularly in the Goulbourn system and Campaspe,\" he said.\\n\\nWorker relocation scheme raises social concerns\\nSocial welfare groups have concerns about Federal Government plans to pay the unemployed to move to regional areas to fill labour shortages.\\nUnder a pilot scheme, the Government will offer potential workers up to $5,000 to move from areas with above-average unemployment.\\nThe Agrifoods Industry Skills Council says there needs to be major infrastructure infrastructure to make the project work.\\nLin Hatfield-Dodds, from the Australian Council of Social Service, has concerns about the impact of the proposal on workers.\\n\"Our concern is just if people do move for work what happens if that job doesn\\'t work out, what supports and what safety nets are we going to put in place to enable people to go back to where they\\'ve come from?\" she said.\\n\"But there\\'s also and probably more importantly the organisational and emotional costs of moving and the relational costs.\\n\"People who do move a large distance for work often find that they can feel isolated.\"\\nThe mining sector does not think the project will help ease the labour shortage.\\nReg Howard-Smith, from the WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy, says the practice of flying workers in and out of mine sites could be a major stumbling block.\\n\"We haven\\'t seen details on what\\'s proposed but if it\\'s a requirement to live in a regional centre, then obviously that precludes people working on a fly-in fly-out basis,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt accused of withholding horticulture reports\\nThe Horticulture Council has accused the Federal Government of withholding two independent reports, which it says highlight major failings in the sector\\'s voluntary code of conduct.\\nThe two-year-old reports into the sector\\'s existing code were only published on the Produce and Industry Ombudman\\'s website today.\\nThe move comes just days after federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran signalled that a new code to improve transparency in the industry, might also be voluntary.\\nThe council\\'s Mark Panitz says the reports back up grower claims that the existing code is not working.\\n\"Look the fundamental issue is that Government\\'s kept these annual reports in the bottom draw so they wouldn\\'t be in the public domain during this debate about the need for a mandatory code,\" he said.\\n\"Now that person\\'s report, an independent report, has said there\\'s systemic problems within the industry within these annual reports and it\\'s also clear evidence that the voluntary code doesn\\'t work.\"\\n\\nThousands flock to Birdsville Races\\nThis weekend all outback roads lead to Queensland\\'s far south-west corner, for the famous Birdsville Races.\\nSpectators and competitors travel for days to attend the two-day race meet, which culminates with the $25,000 Birdsville Cup tomorrow.\\nKaren Brook, the official race photographer, says the organisers are expecting about 6,000 people to attend.\\n\"Last night it was one of the biggest crowds a lot of us have seen,\" she said.\\n\"In town we actually have the Variety Bash Rally ended in Birdsville on Wednesday.\\n\"That in alone put another 700 people in Birdsville on Wednesday night that have now stayed for the weekend.\\n\\nSpring brings higher demand for flowers\\nIt is the first day of spring and today marks the beginning of the peak demand season for fresh flowers.\\nVictorian wild flower farmer James Frew says its the busiest time of the year as he prepares to sell to the hungry Sydney market.\\nHe says the eastern markets are the most lucrative for flower producers.\\n\"The market in Sydney is just, \\'What have you got, what have you got? What can you send me?\" he said.\\n\\nFlower industry \\'needs marketing\\' to blossom\\nFlower growers are being told they need to invest up to half-a-million dollars in a national marketing campaign to boost sales.\\nThe industry generates up to $900 million in farm gate sales each year.\\nBrian Shannon, from the Flower Association of Queensland, says that figure could double, if Australia heeds the British experience.\\n\"They had a marketing campaign over there that increased the sale of cut flowers by 100 per cent over five years,\" he said.\\n\"What we\\'re trying to do is let our members and growers know that this is the sort of thing we need to do in Australia.\\n\\nCattle, lamb slaughterings down\\nThe number of animals being slaughtered for meat across Australia has fallen for the fourth month in a row.\\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics says cattle slaughterings in July fell to 640,000, the lowest since last December.\\n\\nCWA calls for country of origin labels\\nThe Country Women\\'s Association (CWA) is calling on shoppers to buy homegrown produce at the supermarket, to help ensure the survival of Australian agriculture.\\nThe 32nd national conference of the CWA has brought more than 100 delegates to Darwin this week.\\nThe new president, Tasmanian Leslie Young, says cheap imports and the drought mean it is time for everybody to work together.\\n\\nBanana prices tipped to stay high\\nIf you were hoping to see a fall in the price of bananas this month, wholesalers are warning us not to hold our breath.\\nMarket analysts have been predicting a gradual return of bananas to the market, as north Queensland farms recover from the impact of cyclone Larry.\\nThat would lead to lower prices.\\nBut Sydney banana wholesaler Harry Theoharous says those high prices will be around for a few months yet.\\n\"We\\'ve been getting a reasonable volume of fruit out of the New South Wales growing areas and as they\\'ve gone through a very cold winter their supplies now do dwindle away,\" he said.\\n\"We do see a slight increase of fruit coming out of Queensland but we\\'re still looking at around 20 weeks before we get some reasonable volumes coming in.\\n\\nSnail forces citrus shipment redirection\\nA brown snail the size of a pin head has been found in a shipment of Australian citrus fruit being exported to the United States.\\nIt is the second year in a row that a snail from a packing shed in the Sunraysia region has been found by US quarantine officials.\\nPeter Walker, from exporter Riversun, says somehow the snail slipped through local quarantine procedures.\\nThe affected fruit will now have to be sold to another country.\\n\\nQuarantine protocols hit fruit, vegetable growers\\nThe Australian Horticultural Exporters Association says it has never been harder or more expensive to send fruit and vegetables overseas.\\nIt says the value of horticulture exports has fallen $230 million, or 30 per cent, since 2003.\\nDeputy chair David Minnis says tougher quarantine protocols imposed by other countries are taking their toll.\\n\"Just about any fruit that\\'s host for fruit fly - so mangoes, table grapes, stonefruit, cherries, apples, pears, citrus - all of these fruits have restrictions put on their movement into a whole range of countries,\" he said.\\n\\nCattle industry prefers \\'duffing\\' to \\'rustling\\'\\nA move is on to halt the Americanisation of English in rural areas.\\nThe cattle industry is demanding an end to the use of the American phrase \"cattle rustling\" when referring to livestock theft, rather than the more Aussie \"cattle duffing\".\\nLanguage expert Professor Roly Sussex, from the University of Queensland, says the term \"cattle rustling\" is now widespread, but it is neither necessary nor particularly appropriate.\\n\\nNewton named produce Ombudsman\\nA new Ombudsman has been appointed to regulate disputes between fruit and vegetable producers and buyers.\\nIt follows the release of two reports questioning the merits of a voluntary code of conduct for the industry.\\nThe Federal Government has appointed David Newton from the Sydney-based Accord group as the Produce and Grocery Ombudsman.\\nGrowers want a mandatory code of conduct to help them negotiate with supermarkets and wholesalers but the Federal Government seems to be leaning towards a voluntary code.\\nMr Newton says there is nothing wrong with a voluntary code.\\n\"I think there are pluses and minuses in each one, but I wouldn\\'t say that just because a mandatory code is in place that that is going to provide 100 per cent improvement over voluntary,\" he said.\\n\\nWestpac predicts base metals price drops\\nIn the mining sector the shine is coming off the price of base metals, with forecaster Westpac predicting a 35 per cent drop by the end of the year.\\nMining company Consolidated Minerals is blaming a major slump in the price of manganese for a $6 million loss posted yesterday.\\nCommodity strategist Tobin Gorey says base metal prices are closely aligned to the US economy, which is starting to show signs of slowing down.\\n\"It\\'s been about a consumer spending boom, they\\'ve spent a lot of money on a lot of different things, especially houses and so on,\" he said.\\n\"Those consumers in their houses and in their cars and stuff too, use up a lot of metals, particularly copper and so on, and if that demand slows as it is now, then prices will fall.\"\\n\\nWool market climbs slightly\\nThere were slight gains in the wool market this week, with only a small number of bales offered at sales in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle.\\nThe Eastern Market Indicator finished the week at 751 cents a kilogram, up three cents.\\nThe best results were in Melbourne, with finer microns jumping between 10 and 30 cents.\\n\\nDubbo merino ram sales prices down\\nThe tough conditions have been reflected at one of the nation\\'s top merino ram sales, which has recorded lower average prices than last year.\\nThe annual sale at Dubbo in central western New South Wales attracted hundreds of wool growers from across the country hoping to pick up a bargain.\\nThe top price paid was just $18,000 for a local Roseville Park Stud ram, compared to last year\\'s high of $43,000.\\nDave Hart, from Landmark, says some breeders made the most of the keen competition.\\n\"There was a bit of pessimism around in the shed leading up to the sale,\" he said.\\n\"I think it was a great value for money sale for stud and commercial growers, that will tend to happen, they are the rams that the smarter commercial growers will come here and pick up.\\n\\nMurray River winter flows at record low\\nThe Murray River has had its lowest winter flows on record due to the dry conditions across the Murray Darling Basin.\\nIn a normal year almost 4,000 gigalitres of water flows down the system, but this year only about 400 gigalitres was recorded.\\nTrevor Jacobs, from River Murray Water, says New South Wales irrigators will be most affected.\\n\"Very limited water availability to New South Wales in particular,\" he said.\\n\\nAustralia endures driest August since 1900\\nOn this first day of spring there is little surprise at news Australia has endured its driest August since records began in 1900.\\nPreliminary figures show a national average rainfall of just 6.87 millimetres for August.\\nOverall, an average of 43.9 millimetres of rain fell across Australia during the winter.\\nSenior climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, Dr Andrew Watkins, says it has been decades since rain was so scarce.\\n\"Australia-wide we only averaged about 6.2 millimetres for the month, so a very dry month,\" he said.\\n\"Our previous driest Augusts were in 1914 and unfortunately 1982 is also a comparison - it had about 7.5 millimetres.\\n\\nAlpacas killed in dog attack\\nPolice are appealing for public help after four alpacas were killed in a dog attack at Yea in Central Victoria.\\nThe Alpacas were worth about $100,000 each.\\n\\nScientists to tackle ocean census\\nIn a bid to measure the impact of the fishing industry scientists have decided to count every living thing in the ocean.\\nThe world\\'s first ocean census is under way and when it is finished in 2010 it will be used to help regulate the fishing industry.\\nSenior scientist on the project Ron O\\'Dor says identifying every ocean species is proving tough for some researchers.\\n\"They were two and a half kilometres down in the water column on the end of a line chasing this octopus with a slurp gun that goes \\'slurp\\' and sucks the animal in and then brings it back alive,\" he said.\\n\\nNT\\'s Vatskalis replaced by newcomer Natt\\nThe Northern Territory has a new Primary Industries, Fisheries, Mines and Energy Minister.\\nIn a ministerial reshuffle caused by the resignation of health minister Peter Toyne, the portfolio has gone to newcomer Chris Natt.\\nOne of his first jobs as Minister will be to be decide on the controversial McArthur River Mine expansion.\\nHowever outgoing mines minister Kon Vatskalis, who has been promoted to Business, Economic and Regional Development, says Mr Natt\\'s inexperience might actually be an advantage.\\n\"Working to a portfolio that you know nothing [about], it gives you the opportunity to actually develop,\" he said.\\n\"It gives you the opportunity to do something different.\\n\\nMiddle East chefs go on Aussie culinary tour\\nTop chefs and food buyers from the Middle East will tour Australia this month, searching for the best local produce.\\nThe ten-day visit will take in fresh markets and food producing companies in four states.\\nMarketing company Australian Quality Plus hopes to increase sales of meat and seafood to

level in a decade\\nDespite record high prices this year, gold production in Australia has dropped to its lowest level in 10 years.\\nThe latest figures show a fall to 251 tonnes of gold during the past financial year.\\nSandra Close from consultants Surbiton Associates says bad weather during the March quarter is largely to blame, while a lack of exploration is also a problem.\\n\"Since the late \\'90s exploration for gold has gone from about 60 per cent of total mineral exploration expenditure down to around 30 per cent of total mineral exploration expenditure,\" she said.\\n\\nBiofuel industry unviable without Govt support, says expert\\nA new report has confirmed calls by the renewable energy sector for more support from the Federal Government.\\nThe report from Rabobank, a leading agribusiness bank, says a serious biofuels industry is unviable unless there is a long-term policy commitment.\\nSpokeswoman Ingrid Richardson says ethanol and biodiesel production will not be economical unless there are Government mandates.\\n\"My report looks at what\\'s happened in the US, what\\'s happened in Brazil, what\\'s happened in Europe and basically all the support there is very long term,\" she said.\\n\\nCattle producers urged to put off slaughter\\nCattle producers and dairy farmers facing the prospect of another drought in Victoria are being urged to \"park\" their cows rather than send them to slaughter.\\nThe livestock saleyards have been packed with cheap cows and steers, as dry weather and low water allocations hit feed supplies.\\nDoug Chant from United Dairy Farmers of Victoria says agistment schemes have been vital during previous droughts.\\n\"Their only other option is to sell cows to go to slaughter and one of the concerns is that it takes so long to rebuild herds,\" he said.\\n\\nBeattie\\'s reaction to frozen bananas \\'outrageous\\'\\nQueensland Premier Peter Beattie has been accused of using concern over processed banana imports to boost his state election campaign.\\nVoters go to the polls on Saturday.\\nMr Beattie says the Federal Government has broken its promise not to allow banana imports while Queensland growers recover from Cyclone Larry.\\nEleven tonnes of cooked frozen banana pulp from Vietnam has been brought in for use by food manufacturers.\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the local industry is not threatened in any way.\\n\"It\\'s outrageous that the Premier would seize on this and create a quarantine scare when none exists and cause worry for many banana growers, who may not know the true situation,\" he said.\\n\\nCane growers examine damage caused by deluge\\nCane farmers in north Queensland say it is too early to know the extent of damage from massive, unexpected rain.\\nWhile September is supposed to be the driest month in the tropics, some farmers have received up to 665 millimetres in the Herbert River District around Ingham over the weekend.\\nThat is 26 inches on the imperial scale.\\nWhile farmers further south would love even a fraction of that rainfall, plant scientist Ron Van Kerkwyk says it has halted the sugarcane harvest, and could have a disastrous impact on thousands of hectares of newly planted cane.\\n\"Planting is the highest single operative cost you\\'ve got on a farm and it really is a tragedy of some proportions when we get as much rain as we\\'ve had here at this time of the year which, number one is fairly unusual and number two it\\'s impacted by the fact that so much of the plant cane we have got is, relatively speaking, very young,\" he said.\\nIn the south, where the rain is really needed, the dry conditions are starting to hurt South Australia\\'s aquaculture industry.\\nA lack of typical winter weather means oysters are growing slower than normal, due to a lack of food.\\nSimon Turner from Turner Aquaculture at Cowell, on the Eyre Peninsula, says without wind or rain, fewer nutrients are being produced in the seawater to make algae, which is a major food source.\\n\"When we have deep lows that come up from the Southern Ocean, [they] promote upwellings which also create algae and feed for our oysters and that\\'s something that we haven\\'t had much of at all this year,\" he said.\\n\\nSurvey suggests city dwellers in the dark about farms\\nA new Landcare survey shows more than 60 per cent of people living in the capital cities have little or no understanding of Australian farms.\\nIt also shows that only one in three people have ever visited a farm.\\nLandcare commissioned the research to gauge what people know of efforts by farmers to improve the environment.\\nAnd chief executive Brian Scars Brick says the rural sector needs to do more to educate those living in urban areas.\\n\"The worrying trend of course is that for younger people, the figure went right up to 70 per cent of people not knowing what was going on behind the farm gate,\" he said.\\n\\nSheep flock decreasing faster than expected\\nThe Australian sheep flock is diminishing at a greater rate than orginially expected, according to figures just released by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA).\\nThe 2006 Sheep Industry Projections show the national flock has five million sheep fewer than previously thought, at around 100 million, due to the drought.\\nBut overseas demand for Australian prime lamb is booming, with exports to Japan up 30 per cent, and the Middle East market is up by 21 per cent due to strong oil prices.\\nLive exports remain steady at around 4.5 million.\\nMLA\\'s chief market analyst, Peter Weeks, is warning that supply will be tighter, because of the slow task of rebuilding.\\n\"Over the next four years, instead of a 6 per cent a year rise in supply, it\\'s going down to about 2 per cent a year,\" he said.\\n\\nBellamy reflects on Irwin legacy\\nAfter the shock death of naturalist and television star Steve Irwin yesterday, talk is turning to the legacy the Queenslander has left behind.\\nThe man known as the Crocodile Hunter died after being stabbed by a sting ray barb as he filmed a documentary off the coast of far north Queensland.\\nBritish naturalist David Bellamy says he admired Steve Irwin\\'s capacity to invest personally in the environment.\\n\\nGolden spinifex could cut exploration costs\\nSpinifex grass might be a natural signpost to untold wealth, according to research findings in the Tanami Desert.\\nScientists have discovered that spinifex plants can carry traces of gold in their leaves, if they are growing above a mineral deposit.\\nFurther research needs to be done, but mining companies say the discovery could lead to big savings in exploration costs.\\nDr Stephen Rogers from the Cooperative Research Centre for Landscape Environments and Mineral Exploration, says the grass is proving to be a natural metal detector.\\n\"What the plant does is because it lives in very arid regions it needs to get its water from the ground water so it puts the most of its energy into creating this huge single root that penetrates very, very deeply into the regolith, into the cover of the landscape to the ground water,\" he said.\\n\\nHerb and spice group urges research levy\\nThe Australian Herb and Spice Industry Association wants its members to back plans for a levy to fund research and development.\\nAt present, most research is done by growers and processors, with some funding matched by the Rural Industries and Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC).\\nAssociation chairman Robert Hayes says extra funding is needed to look at present management, marketing, and finding export destinations.\\n\"RIRDC will continue to work with us but it has been made plain and clear that they will only do so for so long before the industry has to stand on its own two feet,\" he said.\\n\"Just how long that is we haven\\'t been given any indication, but we\\'re not going to sit around and wait.\\n\\nVic growers plan to fight markets relocation\\nVictorian fruitgrowers and horticultural exporters are planning to fight plans to relocate one of Australia\\'s biggest wholesale markets.\\nThe State Government wants to relocate the markets from inner city Melbourne to the outer northern suburbs, because it believes the existing site is too small.\\nBut spokesman for the growers and market users, Geoff Thomas, says the new site will be a waste of $300 million in taxpayer funding, because no one will use it.\\n\\nTariffs on Thai canned tuna, pineapple raised\\nAustralia has imposed higher tariffs on canned tuna and pineapple from Thailand.\\nThe level of imports of both products this year has reached the threshold to attract extra duty.\\n\\nChina accepts Aust citrus shipment\\nChina has accepted Australia\\'s first official shipment of citrus fruit.\\nA container of Queensland murcott mandarins have been sent overseas under strict new quarantine protocols, which include on-farm inspections and cold sterilisation.\\nIn the past, fruit has entered China through Hong Kong.\\nKevin Parr from Australian Citrus Growers says oranges from southern growing regions have not met the new protocols so far, so mandarin growers can now capitalise on the new export market.\\n\"There\\'s about 15 containers on the water at the moment that are going to arrive over the next fortnight, and one more going today, so I think it\\'s a total of about 15-16 containers,\" he said.\\n\\nTandou exits wine industry\\nDry conditions and the ongoing wine glut have forced a major agribusiness company to leave the wine industry.\\nTandou is selling its 21,000 tonne winery at Monash in South Australia\\'s Riverland, after recording a $6.1 million loss for the past financial year.\\nChief executive Guy Kingwall says the company will be focusing more on its cotton business.\\n\"Tandou obviously is facing significant challenges with the unprecedented drought area, and the flows of water in the Darling River system,\" he said.\\n\\nDry conditions threaten cereal crops\\nOngoing dry conditions are starting to take their toll on winter cereal crops in New South Wales.\\nIn the state\\'s north-west farmers are already reporting failed crops, and are turning sheep and cattle into the paddocks to salvage what is left after the dry winter.\\nEd Colless from the Special One Farmers Cooperative at Walgett, says crops planted on minimal moisture are starting to wither, and without substantial rain, many more will end as stock feed soon.\\n\\nEPA defends Burrup gas project go-ahead\\nThe Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in Western Australia has defended its decision to approve the development of the Pluto Liquefied Natural Gas project on the Burrup Peninsula.\\nMajor oil and gas producer Woodside wants to build a processing facility on the north-west peninsula, which houses what is believed to be the world\\'s biggest collection of aboriginal rock art.\\nThe Greens are outraged at the EPA\\'s decision, and are calling on the state and federal governments to block the development.\\nBut EPA chairman Wally Cox says the project is unlikely to compromise environmental or cultural objectives.\\n\"The company has been very responsible in the way it\\'s negotiated with the local Indigenous people,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s changed its proposal on the way through to accommodate any concern the Aboriginal communities had.\\n\\nOnline shopping takes off as petrol prices remain high\\nHigh retail and petrol prices are believed to have contributed to a big jump in Internet shopping in regional Australia.\\nACNeilsen figures show shopping has increased by 20 per cent in the last year alone, with almost 1.5 million country people connected to the web.\\nWestern Queensland online shopper Janet Powne says it is more about convenience.\\nShe lives in Bollon, which is 500 kilometres from the nearest major shopping centre.\\n\"I just started out by mainly shopping for gifts - because we don\\'t have a selection of gift stores that I can readily get to, I started investigating what\\'s online and one Christmas I bought all my gifts online,\" she said.\\n\\nCattle, worker shortage blamed for early abattoir closure\\nAustralia\\'s second largest meat processor Teys Brothers is blaming a lack of cattle and a chronic labour shortage for its decision to close its abattoir in far north Queensland three-and-a-half months early.\\nThe Innisfail meatworks normally closes for the wet season in December.\\nOne hundred and sixty workers will be affected, and chief executive Brad Teys says the company will try to relocate them to other plants, and move cattle by train to southern abattoirs.\\n\\nCompetition policy \\'hurting rural communities\\'\\nA new report says Australia\\'s push to become internationally competitive has hurt the economic well-being of country communities.\\nResearch think-tank, the Australian Farm Institute, says National Competition Policy has affected essential services and infrastructure development in country towns.\\nExecutive director Mick Keogh says a lack of decision-making at the regional level, and confusion over state and federal policy, is not helping.\\n\"Sometimes regional policy development seems to be aimed at increasing the population in rural centres, sometimes it seems to be aimed at bringing new industries into regional areas, sometimes it seems to be aimed at easing congestion in capital cities,\" he said.\\n\"So, I think a lot of confusion exists and a lot of government packages that are called regional development packages don\\'t seem to have a clear objective.\"\\nFederal Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Warren Truss, says the Government is committed to ensuring country towns have a full range of services.\\nBut he says the Government expects regional communities to identify what they need themselves and then come forward with those projects.\\n\\nWarmer seas could be affecting lobster catches\\nVictorian fisheries officers say rising sea temperatures could be one factor causing a drop in rock lobster catches off the state\\'s west coast.\\nGovernment monitoring programs and independent surveys have found the amount of lobsters fishermen have been able to catch has dropped by 10 percent in two years.\\nPeter Appleford from Fisheries Victoria says it could be some time before scientists can establish whether it is due to environmental change, but some trends are emerging.\\n\"It\\'s been noted that the water temperatures have been higher than normal,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s also been noted that in western Victoria there\\'s been less frequent and weaker cold water upwellings which affect the fishery.\\n\\nOvernight rain welcome but not drought-breaking\\nVictorian farmers say overnight rain has given dying crops a reprieve and delayed decisions to sell livestock.\\nMore than 20 millimetres has fallen across many parts of the Wimmera Mallee, a region that has had no significant rain since July, and where reservoirs are at criticially low levels.\\nFarmers say this rain will not break the drought, but will keep their crops alive for another couple of weeks.\\n\"A lot of the stubble crops I think will fire up a bit - they were nearly dead, pretty yellow, but the fallow was okay, it was just hanging on,\" he said.\\n\"But mainly my stock, I can hang onto my stock.\\n\"We can look forward I guess to two or three more weeks, then we\\'re looking for quite a bit more rain in the springtime to finish the crops off.\\n\"We\\'ve had 14, it\\'ll turn it around pretty well for a couple of weeks. It was getting pretty desperate up until now.\\n\\nWater market does roaring trade\\nThe water market in southern New South Wales is doing a roaring trade, as irrigators try to secure extra water for winter crops.\\nInternet trading company Waterfind says there was a 10-fold increase in water movement during August, with almost 30,000 megalitres sold in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys.\\nPrices have peaked at $350 a megalitre, with the average price closer to $150.\\nBrett Tucker from Murrumbidgee Irrigation says after six years of drought some producers are selling water for high prices, rather than using it themselves.\\n\"You can\\'t blame people for selling, there\\'s been such a differential in the markets this year that I think the Murray valley\\'s become more attractive,\" he said.\\n\"Ultimately people need to do whatever they can to get through these sort of circumstances.\\n\\nSheep producers urged to offload stock\\nSheep producers in Western Australia are being urged to get rid of stock as soon as possible, because the seasonal indicators show the season is not going to improve.\\nWith ongoing dry weather, stock numbers are already down between 25 and 50 per cent in the northern zone, but with a lack of feed, authorities say more will have to go.\\nTim Wiley from the Department of Agriculture and Food says if farmers hold off too much longer, they will have to shoot stock, because it will be too expensive to get them ready for market.\\n\"The earlier you reduce stock numbers, the less stock you\\'ll have to get rid of,\" he said.\\n\\nWheat, barley forecasts drop due to dry conditions\\nThe big dry has led the Emerald Group to dramatically lower its wheat and barley forecasts.\\nThe commodity management company is predicting a crop of 16 million tonnes of wheat, possibly rising to 19 million under ideal spring conditions.\\nBarley production is expected at six million tonnes, and a canola crop of one million tonnes.\\nExecutive director Mike Chaseling says lower wheat and barley forecasts have had a big impact on prices.\\n\"It\\'s been a spectacular rally here, basis levels have driven up relative to US futures dramatically in the last month or so,\" he said.\\n\"Barley prices are up $60 for the month, there\\'s been a spectacular rally here.\\n\"Barley is trading in and around $230 a tonne, port less rail, right through most port zones in Eastern Australia and a bit higher in northern port zones.\\n\\nAWB\\'s Iraq scandal costs expected to surge\\nA new estimate predicts AWB\\'s legal costs and fines associated with the Iraq wheat scandal could surge to $280 million.\\nSharemarket analyst Austock says possible legal action by North American farmers and Australian shareholders, and potential fines from the Australian Tax Office and the Australia Federal Police will affect costs.\\nBut lawyers representing North American farmers, estimate their claim alone will cost the wheat exporter $1 billion.\\nAtlanta lawyer Rodney Edmund says growers want to make AWB accountable for its actions.\\n\\'\\'We\\'re working with lawyers in Australia. We\\'re working with lawyers in Washington DC,\" he said.\\n\"Quite frankly we have lawyers in New York right now who are quite frankly ready to take a bite into this thing and obviously the only way

rewards\\nFarmers are expected to be the big winners from changes to superannuation legislation introduced to Federal Parliament this week by the Treasurer, Peter Costello.\\nUntil next June, retiring farmers will be able to tip up to $1 million into their super schemes, to make the most of tax-free payouts available to the over-60s from July 1.\\nRichard Gilbert from the Investment and Financial Planning Services Association expects to see a big shift in property.\\n\"I think there is a general feeling around the industry I work in that there will be movements of assets in order to take advantage of this,\" he said.\\n\"Typically it\\'s probably the property assets, probably the things that they\\'ll be looking at are the lumpy assets that may well be moved.\\n\"But those decisions have to be done carefully and with due judgement on the market, need to think twice if they\\'re selling it off at a fire sale price.\"\\nBut there are fears the changes could make it harder for managed investment schemes to attract funds.\\nThe schemes, which include plantation timber and almond groves, have traditionally relied on tax breaks to attract support.\\nBut Michael Spinks from the Institute of Chartered Accountants says investors might now top up their super instead.\\n\"Prior to the changes a lot of investors probably saw agribusiness as a good way of reducing their tax,\" he said.\\n\\nOil price drop predicted\\nThe price of oil is predicted to drop by almost a third within the next five years.\\nThat is the forecast Angus Walker from chartered accountants Ernst and Young delivered to an oil conference in Perth yesterday.\\nHe says while the US economy is slowing down due to lower domestic spending, it is being balanced out by the expanding economies of China and India.\\nMr Walker says that will hold oil prices firm in the short term, before the market corrects.\\n\"The Chinese are expected to increase their use of oil by 156 per cent by 2030, it is the largest increase of oil usage of any country in history,\" he said.\\n\"In India, it\\'s going to increase it\\'s use of oil by around 124 per cent.\\n\\nMine to give Tiwi Is jobs boost\\nA new sand mine on the Tiwi Islands north of Darwin is set to boost employment for the local Aboriginal community.\\nMatilda Minerals will produce 200,000 tonnes of the heavy mineral concentrate, zircon-rutile over the next six years.\\nManaging director Bruce Maluish says he wants to reduce the environmental impact of mining an island in the Torres Strait.\\n\"The sand averages about 4 per cent heavy mineral,\" he said.\\n\"The process involves mining the sand, processing it, extracting the 5 per cent of heavy mineral and putting the sand back in the hole where it came from.\\n\"So it\\'s a pretty benign impact and we can be mining through areas quite quickly at low impact, and come back and rehabilitate the land quite smartly as well.\"\\n\\nSeason\\'s first mangoes sold for $25,000\\nHundreds of greengrocers packed the Sydney Produce Markets this morning for the annual charity auction of the season\\'s first box of mangoes.\\nThe 12 mangoes, from Pine Creek Plantation in the Northern

Makybe Diva and the emerging stallion Gallileo.\\nAnd, to add that special touch, Stud manager Peter O\\'Brien says owner Tony Santic asked for the Diva\\'s favourite song to get her in the mood.\\n\"We had candles outside her stable, and we had Deborah Conway\\'s It\\'s Only the Beginning, was the song chosen to bring the romantic side on.\\n\"That was seemingly her song they used to

irrigators in the outback community of Bourke to pump emergency water supplies out of the dwindling Darling River.\\nThe Bourke region has been suffering drought conditions for more than five years, and irrigators are battling to keep citrus trees, grape vines and hojoba plants alive.\\nPhil Mansell from Back of Bourke Fruits says tough decision are being made about whether to let crops die, with no guarantee of future water flows.\\n\"We have a grape crop there that we have to now make the decision, will we have the water to take that crop through into a harvest?\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s a further million dollar investment to do the work to grow that crop, and the easiest thing to do is just to turn the water off a significantly large area of vines.\\n\"But the financiers are facing a terrible dilemma, they are considering what does that do to the community, what does it do to jobs in town et cetera?\"\\n\\nFeed grain users move to import\\nThe Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has confirmed that some feed grain users are looking to import stocks for the first time since 2002.\\nAQIS, which approves import permits, says it has had casual discussions with users, but no formal application has been lodged.\\nGrain is imported when Australia\\'s supply is low and domestic prices are dearer than international prices.\\nElders general manager of grains, Phillip Pyle, says while prices are not high enough to justify importing yet, they have moved up rapidly in the past month.\\n\"Prices are up pretty dramatically,\" he said.\\n\\nNSW irrigators saved from huge tax compo bill\\nNew South Wales irrigators who won a $100 million compensation package after losing access to ground water will no longer lose a big part of the money in tax.\\nFourteen hundred irrigators received money to compensate them for a move to claim back over-allocated ground water resources.\\nThe Federal Government had treated the payments as income, and demanded tax be paid.\\nPrime Minister John Howard has now intervened, saying the money is compensation and should not be taxed.\\nBut Federal Member for Gwydir, John Anderson, admits not all payments will be tax-free.\\n\"If it\\'s a pre-85 asset, which most of them would be, there\\'s no tax,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt working to clear 457 visa hold-ups\\nThe Federal Government says it is trying to fix problems with the temporary skilled migration program, which have halted visa applications since April.\\nUnder the 457 program, skilled workers are being imported to fill labour shortages, particularly in the meat industry.\\nBut visa applications have been held up, after claims some sectors of the industry have breached the terms of the agreement.\\nImmigration Minister, Senator Amanda Vanstone, says a new labour agreement is being put together, which will clearly define worker skills.\\n\"What I think has been happening is people have been bringing in people described as slaughtermen and butchers and they have been doing boning and slicing work which is inconsistent with the visa as it\\'s constructed now,\" she said.\\n\\nRSPCA angry at piggery raid\\nAn animal rights raid on a New South Wales piggery has met with anger from the RSPCA.\\nThe piggery near Young was raided in July, where video footage of the raid was gathered.\\nThe footage has only just been sent to police, with allegations about animal cruelty surrounding sow pens.\\nChief executive of the New South Wales branch of the RSPCA, Bernie Murphy, says extremists should be stopped from entering properties.\\n\"They go onto a property, they breach the biosecurity, they may visit great harm on the well-being of the animals plus of course they are having an impact on people\\'s livelihoods.\\n\"No one would tolerate someone invading someone\\'s house and this is similar to that in a business sense.\\n\"These people believe because they have the moral high ground in their mind, they can go onto properties, break the law, ignore it.\\n\\nMine company ordered to pay former exec compo\\nA Western Australian mining company has been ordered to pay more than $1.8 million to a former senior executive, after failing to disclose a nickel discovery.\\nThe Supreme Court of Western Australia yesterday awarded the money to Kim Riley, a former managing director and shareholder of Jubilee Mines.\\nIn late 1994, rival company Western Mining Corporation told Jubilee Mines it had inadvertently found the nickel deposit on Jubilee\\'s tenement in the northern goldfields.\\nHowever Jubilee Mines did not publicly provide information of the find until two years later.\\nIn that time, Mr Riley sold his entire holding in the company.\\nHe says he would have been in a different position about selling the shares if he had known about the discovery.\\n\"I\\'ve got mixed emotions, I am very relieved,\" he said.\\n\"It was a stressful period for myself, also for my wife and children, I\\'m glad that it\\'s over.\"\\n\\nHuman error \\'probable cause\\' of GM canola mix-up\\nHuman error has been identified as the most likely cause of the genetically-modified contamination of conventional canola two years ago.\\nLow level contamination of the commercially-grown \\'grace\\' variety was discovered in 2005 during routine sampling of canola exports.\\nA trial of GM canola was conducted in Tasmania in 1998, and a year later grace canola was grown on a separate site three kilometres away, but an investigation by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator has found that is not how the contamination occured.\\nAlex Schaap from Tasmania\\'s Department of Primary Industry says there is not enough evidence to provide a definite answer.\\n\"The mystery still remains as to what the source of the contamination is,\" he said.\\n\"The only hypothesis left standing is some form of human error, perhaps something as simple as somebody not labelling seed bags correctly, and seed hence being mixed.\"\\nThe peak grains research body says it is continuing negotiations to try to secure the commercial release of genetically modified crops.\\nThe Grains Research and Development Corporation is funding research into GM canola, which cannot be released to farmers because of state-imposed bans on the technology.\\nChairman Terry Enright says the benefits of GM crops, such as disease tolerant wheat and barley, need to be proven.\\n\"We\\'re positively working with industry and with governments in a dialogue to make sure that we overcome these issues that are there,\" he said.\\n\"And we\\'re hopeful in the long term that if crops become available and can be assessed on a crop by crop basis, if they demonstrate benefit to the industry, that ultimately we\\'ll be able to grow them, if that is what is required.\"\\nMeanwhile, Nufarm has bought the licence to develop and commercialise genetically-modified canola.\\nThe agribusiness company has paid $10 million for Monsanto\\'s Roundup Ready canola licence and germ plasm.\\n\\nInland rail link inches forward\\nThe Federal Government says a new inland

contribute two thirds.\\nThe Federal Government wants the line to be in operation by 2019.\\nMinister Truss says there will be consultation on the best route, but one is a particular stand-out.\\n\"Now that particular corridor would cost about 3.1 billion dollars to build and achieve a transit time of just under 21 hours,\" he said.\\n\\nDairy industry pledges $15m to fighting fund\\nA new national Dairy Innovation Centre has been tasked with finding ways to compete with the growing soy milk market.\\nSeven milk companies have pledged $15 million to the centre, which will

farmers.\\n\"We\\'ll be looking at protecting their price, their milk price, we live in a very competitive environment both as a dairy industry but also dairy industry competing with other food products such as soy, and so this is really a protection strategy,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt under fire over delay in delivering horticulture conduct code\\nLabor and the Greens have attacked the Federal Government for delays in implementing a code of conduct for the horticulture sector.\\nIt has been almost 700 days since the Coalition made an election promise to introduce a mandatory code to improve transparency between growers and wholesalers.\\nA motion put forward yesterday by the Greens in the Senate, to clarify when the issue will be addressed, was narrowly defeated by the Coalition.\\nGreens Senator Christine Milne says that is a clear sign the Government is trying to renege on its promise.\\n\"It\\'s an absolute disgrace that they are now trying to find a way to make it some sort of rambling voluntary code,\" she said.\\n\"The Greens believe that it should be a mandatory code, that\\'s why we moved in the Senate to call on the Government to fulfil their election promise and what we\\'re seeing is delay until after the Queensland election and I can almost bet my bottom dollar that they will come out with some gobbledly-gook about some voluntary codes next week.\"\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran is defending the delay.\\n\"I realise there\\'s great anger growing amongst many who believe that the mandatory code of conduct would be automatically be introduced, we\\'re still working our way through all of the issues,\" he said.\\n\\nAWB in bidding war to supply wheat to Indian company\\nAWB is one of four companies left in a bidding war to supply

cent.\\nSouth Korea\\'s Agriculture Ministry has just announced that 36 US slaughterhouses designated to handle meat for export to South Korea met required safety measures, clearing the last hurdle to the resumption of imports.\\nMLA Korean manager, Glen Feist says the Americans have had a tough time convincing the Koreans to accept meat with bone chip fragment.\\n\"The protocol is no bones, but everybody knows in our industry that from time to time you do get bone chips on the primal cuts of beef through boning problems, especially in the biggest US plants,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt rejects call to dump freight equalisation scheme\\nThe Federal Government has dismissed calls to scrap Tasmania\\'s freight equalisation scheme.\\nUnder the scheme, Tasmanian producers receive a rebate on freight to offset the high cost of shipping across Bass Straight.\\nA draft report just released by the Productivity Commission says the scheme is too costly and should be phased out.\\nBut the Government says the program will stay, a move welcomed by president of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, Roger Swan.\\n\"I think the PM has put the matter to rest for now, but I think what we do see from this is that politicians of all shapes, sizes and colours understand that this is a vital issue for Tasmania\\'s industry and it\\'s an issue that we have to keep certainly our finger on,\"

wants a national mandatory grower levy to fund efforts to stop the spread of sugarcane smut.\\nThe fungal disease was found almost three months ago near Childers, in Queensland\\'s south-east.\\nAlthough a proposed national cost-sharing plan has already been knocked back, the sugar industry says it wants a compulsory levy to raise about $9 million.\\nBut Joe Russo from Isis Canegrowers admits there is still a lot of work to be done.\\n\"We\\'ve got to now get New South Wales canegrowers to come on board,\" he said.\\n\"They\\'ve agreed in principle, we\\'ve got to get the Ord River - but the other thing we\\'ve got to do is - the Federal Government now has got to put mechanisms in place that we need to be able to strike this levy on all cane growing in the Australian sugar industry.\"\\n\\nAgriculture research process under scrutiny\\nPressure is on Australia\\'s agricultural research and development corporations (RDCS) to justify how they spend taxpayer dollars.\\nThe chairs of 14 peak bodies have been meeting in Canberra this week.\\nParliamentary secretary for Agriculture, Sussan Ley, wants more collaboration between the agencies, and a uniform way of assessing whether their research work is up to scratch.\\n\"I\\'m waiting for them to come back to me with that, but I certainly don\\'t want it to be a long process,\" she said.\\n\"I want it to be an efficient process, I want it to be realistic and I want it to produce answers for people who have every right to ask the question, \\'are we getting value for money?\\' - it\\'s important to recognise that governments are really a major stakeholder in the RDC\\'s.\\n\\nDrought-stricken farmers disappointed with Govt response\\nVictorian farmers facing water shortages say are

announced more funding for rural financial counselling services.\\nMallee farmer Claire Cook has had to sell most of her sheep, and says most of her crops have died.\\n\"It\\'s a very political, very politician\\'s response, as in, \\'we\\'ll have a look and we\\'ll have a discussion about it\\',\" she said.\\n\"I was hoping for something a bit more practical, as in some subsidies, maybe for some tanks that we\\'re all going to have to buy in order for the water, hopefully that will be carted to us, or that we\\'ll cart ourselves.\\n\\nWool broker raises concerns about stock feed supplies\\nA

overnight, but there is still growing concern about how stock will be fed in the coming months.\\nTrevor Pedlar from Primaries of WA says he has travelled through much of the state recently and there is going to be a need to purchase feed to keep stock on farm.\\nBut he says the cost and availability of imported feed will be an issue.\\n\"Things are tough in a lot of areas around the world,\" he

probably over-valued some rams,\" he said.\\n\\nVets lobby for mandatory attendance at outback rodeos\\nVets in the Northern Territory are calling for their attendance to be mandatory at all outback rodeos.\\nThe call was prompted after a horse stumbled and broke its leg at an event earlier this year where a vet was not present.\\nHowever some rodeo organisers, like Rod Haines of Pine Creek, say there are not enough vets and the cost would be prohibitive.\\n\"The stock people up here that work these rodeos, work the stock every day and they know what is ill and what\\'s not ill and I think it\\'s up to their judgement to keep it that way,\" he said.\\n\"They don\\'t want to put sick animals out there in front of the audience and it doesn\\'t make the sport look good.\\n\"If you are going to have a vet at rodeo\\'s you would need a vet at every sport that involves animals and that includes pigeon races, cane toad races, pony club, gymkhana\\'s, camp drafting.\"\\nThe Australian

Government says the new code will be legally enforceable, and provide transparency to growers.\\nBut John Roach from grower group Ausveg, is disappointed.\\n\"I think the underpinning side of all this is good business practice and one of the things about the mandatory code, as originally proposed, was that it would be about good business practice,\" he said.\\n\"Any watering down of that is a concern, however if this is the way forward then we give it a damn good shot, as an outcome, hopefully other people will bring the same goodwill to the table.\"\\nGrowers and wholesalers will meet

more fishermen preparing to leave the sector under a Federal Government licence buy-back, Will Mure from Mure\\'s Fishing in Hobart says the trend will continue.\\n\"I guess it\\'s just coming terms with the fact that the fishing industry is going through some fairly serious changes right now and that the price of local quality produce, you\\'ll have to pay a premium price for it,\" he said.\\n\\nDollar strength threatens asparagus viability\\nThe high Australian dollar is threatening to force even more asparagus growers out of business this harvest.\\nAsparagus is sold into the key Japanese market in yen, meaning that as the value of the Australian dollar strengthens, growers are getting less and less money for the same amount of produce.\\nSean Lembrey from Australia\\'s largest asparagus exporter Momack Produce says an asparagus glut here in Australia is not out of the question.\\n\"At the moment it\\'s profitable right now but we are at the very beginning of our season,\" he said.\\n\\nDry conditions prompt early fire work\\nForestry companies in South Australia have started fire prevention work nearly a month early, due to the dry conditions.\\nForestry SA, which manages around 130 hectares of softwood plantations and native forest, has begun work on firebreaks, cleared internal tracks and trained extra crew.\\nSpokesman Rick Underdown says the potential for bush fires is extremely high, especially in the native forests.\\n\"We are particularly worried about that because low rainfall means that the soils are still relatively dry and the fuels in the native forests, that\\'s the litter on the ground and the dead matter just above that, dries out at the same rate as the soils,\" he said.\\n\\nBushfires damage NT mango crops\\nBushfires have damaged almost ripe mangoes on up to 10 orchards near Darwin, in the Northern Territory.\\nMore than 50 volunteers have been battling the fires across 30 square kilometres in the Darwin River area, south of the territory capital.\\nWith the mango harvest only a few weeks away, senior fire control officer Andrew Turner says the property loss could have been prevented.\\n\"Fire has covered about 110 blocks to date, many of them haven\\'t had any sort of fire planning put in place at all,\" he said.\\n\"With the grasses, they really need to be managed and many of the land holders out there aren\\'t managing sufficiently.\\n\"Hopefully this event and the coverage that it has got will encourage people to do the right thing and ensure they have a good and solid plan.\\n\"Certainly there is slashing and mowing that can certainly carry on.\"\\n\\nWater policy \\'ignores climate change\\'\\nA Senate committee says current government policies to regulate water have not considered the impact of climate change on future water availability.\\nThe Rural Affairs Committee is investigating how Australia accounts for its water use and allocation.\\nIts interim report says changing rainfall and temperatures are not reflected in policy initiatives.\\nCommittee chair, Greens Senator Rachel Siewert, says submissions to the inquiry show alarming trends.\\n\"It appears to us that the impact of climate change on rainfall and subsequent water supplies has not been adequately accounted for,\" she said.\\n\\nBeef industry worried at US \\'grain-fed\\' labelling plans\\nMeat and Livestock Australia (MLA) is worried at US plans to allow beef from cattle that have spent time in feedlots and eaten grain, to be labelled \"grass-fed\".\\nMLA regional manager Michelle Gorman says Australia prides itself on being a leader in grass-fed beef.\\nMs Gorman says USDA must remember the consumer when it rewrites the rules on grass-fed labelling.\\n\"There are people that are interested in how the animal has been raised ... and we have many other product categories here, whether it\\'s natural, organic, grain-fed,\" she said.\\n\"It\\'s just another product in the range and there needs to be some accuracy in the type, how the product was and then, how it\\'s labelled.\"\\nMs Gorman says sales of Australian beef cuts in North America are growing month on month, and the grass-fed label is working.\\n\\nCommodities boom \\'going strong\\' despite prices\\nThe price of oil has hit a five-month low, and gold has tumbled below $US600 an ounce, but one market analyst rejects claims the commodities boom is almost over.\\nRob Brierly from broking firm Hartleys says commodity prices have experienced months of volatility, and the current dramatic drop in prices is being driven by speculators.\\nThe lower prices have dragged down the Australian sharemarket by 46 points, but Mr Brierly is confident that a correction is just around the corner.\\n\"We might see a couple more days of weakness, or even a week of weakness but I\\'m sure it will turn around because the fundamentals are still very strong,\" he said.\\n\"Inventories are very low for most commodities, there\\'s not a lot of new projects coming on stream in the near term and demand from places like China is still very, very strong.\"\\n\\nCoalition parties at odds on fruit, veg code\\nThe Federal Liberal and National parties appear to be on a collision course over the proposed code of conduct for the fruit and vegetable industry.\\nDesigned to give growers more transparency when selling their produce, Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane says the code will not be mandatory.\\nBut Nationals Senator Ron Boswell has told reporter Shelley Lloyd that a mandatory version remains on the table, as originally promised before the 2004 election.\\n\"It was an election commitment that I campaigned on, it was an election commitment that was in an official policy document,\" he said.\\n\"I\\'m saying, a mandatory code was a commitment that we gave at the election and that\\'s a commitment they expect to be honoured.\"\\nA spokeswoman for Minister Macfarlane says the code will be enforceable, and deliver the same benefits, without costing millions of dollars required to implement a mandatory system.\\nShe says a mandatory code was not Coalition policy at the last election.\\nThe National Farmers Federation (NFF) says it will walk away from this week\\'s talks on developing the new code, if its requirements are not met.\\nGrowers and wholesalers will meet in Canberra on Thursday to thrash out the details.\\nNFF vice-president Charles Burke says the code needs to force wholesalers to provide more information to growers during price negotiations, improve contracts, and include a dispute resolution process.\\n\"What guarantee do we have as producers that this process is going to lead to an outcome?\" he said.\\n\"Because we\\'ve just participated in the one that didn\\'t.\\n\\nHi-tech quarantine lab set up in Darwin\\nSuspect plant diseases and insects gathered across northern Australia and Asia will now be checked in new secure hi-tech laboratories in Darwin.\\nMore than $3 million has been spent creating the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service\\'s new headquarters.\\nPlant pathologist Jane Ray says the upgrade includes filter systems to ensure that no material escapes or hitchhikes on staff.\\n\"This facility is specifically designed to handle pathogens of quarantine concern like citrus canker for example,\" she said.\\n\"Citrus canker could be worked on in the bio-hazard cabinet, which would enable the pathogen to be contained within the cabinet.\\n\"The negative pressure and the procedures and protocols in place would prevent the escape of this pathogen.\\n\"We could actually diagnose it here, rapidly and move for eradication, rather than actually delaying diagnosis as well.\"\\nAnother hi-tech quarantine lab is due to be constructed in Cairns, North Queensland.\\n\\nDorper sheep sale sets record price\\nSheep that can produce both wool and meat are becoming increasingly popular, with a South Australian dorper ram fetching the top price of $41,000 at the breed\\'s national sale yesterday.\\nThat is a long way above the top price of $18,000 paid for a merino ram at a major sale just weeks ago.\\nBuyers and sellers from WA, South Australia and Queensland attended the sale at Dubbo, in central western New South Wales, and Paul Jamieson from Elders says there was an almost 100 per cent clearance rate for the 120 rams offered.\\n\\nLindemans to include foreign wine\\nThe Foster\\'s Group says it will sell South African and Chilean wine under its Lindemans brand, which has traditionally been exclusively Australian.\\nThe beverage giant says it is a result of research in key export markets, which shows shoppers buy wine because it is good value for money, rather than its origin.\\nBut some in the local industry says the Foster\\'s research undermines efforts being made to market wine under the \"Wine Australia\" banner.\\nMike Stone from Murray Valley Winegrowers says the move should serve as a warning for wine grape producers.\\n\"How long before we have major Australian wine companies simply buying grapes from the cheapest source?\" he said.\\n\"Does it mean that even in a few years\\' time that Australian wine grape growers will be in competition with growers from other countries?\\n\\nFarmers threaten legal action over SA pulp mill plans\\nLocal farmers are threatening legal action to halt the development of a pulp mill near Penola in South Australia.\\nThe $650 million mill won conditional approval yesterday, but still needs final Federal Government consent.\\nBut the local landholder opposition group, the No Pulp Mill Alliance, says the development will lower water tables and increase air pollution.\\nSpokesman Duan Butler says the group is prepared for a fight.\\n\"We\\'ve been saying all along that we would go as far as we had to go,\" he said.\\n\\nGrain traders question AWB pricing\\nThe latest world crop forecast out of the US has local grain traders questioning why exporter AWB is not offering Australian wheat growers a lot more for their grain this season.\\nWhile there is little change to the North American crop outlook, the United States Department of Agriculture has downgraded its estimate of Australia\\'s wheat crop to 19.5 million tonnes.\\nWith supply tighter, and improving overseas grain prices, commodity trader Tony Smith says growers want to know why AWB is not offering higher national pool prices.\\n\"We don\\'t think the AWB\\'s doing the wrong thing if they\\'re being conservative, by any stretch of the imagination, but I think there\\'s a lot of growers out there now thinking, well do I put it in the pool, I\\'m going to have some real cash flow problems this year, or do I sell for cash?\" he said.\\n\"They probably just need to be given a little bit more information than they normally would.\\n\"If the AWB is being conservative by five or so bucks a tonne, then growers won\\'t have a problem with that. But I think they just need to come out and say it.\"\\n\\nMurray irrigators face water price hike\\nRiver Murray irrigators in South Australia are paying up to four times more for water, as the dry conditions continue across the Murray Darling Basin.\\nTemporary water prices have reached an average of $165 a megalitre this month - that\\'s an increase from $44 a megalitre recorded this time last year.\\nThese prices have not been seen since restrictions were first imposed in South Australia four years ago.\\nLow commodity prices and dry conditions have also seen irrigators sell their water entitlements earlier than usual.\\n\\nFarmers back Wimmera water decision\\nFarmers have welcomed a decision by the Victorian Government to halt environmental flows down rivers in the Wimmera region.\\nWith water storages at critical levels, the government says the water earmarked for the environment will be reserved for emergencies including fire fighting.\\nColin Coates from the Victorian Farmers Federation\\'s Drought Committee,\\nis worried about how quickly fire brigades will be able to get hold of it.\\n\"It\\'s a long way on a hot northerly day to cart water out this area, so that is a big concern,\" he said.\\n\\nPacific seasonal workers move criticised\\nA new report condemns the push to import workers from the Pacific to fill seasonal labour shortages.\\nThe think tank Centre for Independent Studies says migration would delay the Pacific region\\'s attempt to address its economic problems.\\nInstead it wants welfare changes, to encourage Aboriginals and the long-term unemployed into the workforce.\\nMilton James from Cape York Partnerships employs Aboriginal people from the region to pick fruit along the Murray River.\\nHe supports the idea, but says it is not a quick fix solution.\\n\\nAnalysts downplay mining share price \\'correction\\'\\nWith shares in major mining companies continuing to nosedive, some analysts say the stock market is witnessing an overdue correction.\\nPrices for metals including copper, iron ore, nickel and zinc have dramatically fallen in recent days, dragging down shares in companies like BHP, Rio Tinto, Woodside and Zinifex.\\nStocks analyst Peter Stracken says the weakening US economy is partly to blame, but market sentiment is also settling to a much more sustainable level.\\nMr Stracken says while miners are being hit with higher production costs, their stocks are fundamentally sound.\\n\"It has been pretty well a free-fall when you get Zinifex falling 10 per cent yesterday in one day,\" he said.\\n\"You know, when you look at the longer term share price chart, BHP has come from like, $12 or $18 to $30, so now it\\'s back at $26.\\n\"If you bought in the last 6 months or so you\\'re not looking so good but if you bought 3 years ago you\\'re still going to double your money.\"\\nMeanwhile new figures from the Bureau of Statistics show export earnings from the minerals energy sector jumped 32 per cent during 2005-06 to a record $90.5 billion.\\n\\nVeg industry outlines growth plans\\nThe vegetable industry will aim to double the value of its fresh, processed and packaged vegetables by 2020.\\nA strategic plan for the industry has been launched this morning in Canberra, just over a year after farmers rallied on the lawns of Parliament House to complain about the impact of cheap imports on their farm businesses.\\nTasmanian farmer and campaigner Richard Bovill says the plan aims to improve communication between everyone in the supply chain, from growers to consumers.\\n\"In the past we\\'ve focussed on fixing up problems,\" he said.\\n\"This strategic plan looks to opportunities and looks to investing in creating opportunities. We have to grow the business.\\n\\nAlice locals encouraged to pull weeds for fitness\\nA new sporting body in Alice Springs wants to help people become fit by helping the environment.\\nEnviro Sports Australia will try to encourage people to pull weeds for exercise.\\nPresident Adrian James says although it is an unusual combination, everyone is a winner.\\n\"One event I\\'d like to get started in the not too distant future is something in some of the land around Alice, probably in the Todd River, in sections that are heavily infested with environmental weeds,\" he said.\\n\\nWholesalers promise to fight mandatory fruit, veg code\\nFruit and vegetable wholesalers say they will take legal action if forced to sign up to a mandatory code of conduct for the horticulture sector.\\nPrime Minister John Howard has now flagged the possibility of making the code mandatory, after fierce opposition from the Nationals and farmers to a proposed voluntary code.\\nGrower groups and market representatives will meet in Canberra tomorrow to debate the proposal.\\nBut spokesman for the Central Markets Association, Andrew Young, says wholesalers will not be forced into a mandatory system.\\n\"The wholesaling sector has continued to take the position that they wouldn\\'t support a mandatory code, and in fact has questioned whether it would be able to be lawfully imposed upon just one sector of the industry,\" he said.\\n\\nWhey extract to help cancer patients\\nA South Australian company has developed a method of using milk to relieve the side-effects of cancer treatment.\\nAn extract from whey, a by-product of cheese-making, has been identified as a potential mouthwash treatment for mouth ulcers which affect around 40 per cent of cancer patients.\\nDr Leanna Read from Adelaide-based TGR BioSciences says the product is close to being available for cancer patients.\\n\"We\\'ve just entered what\\'s called a phase two clinical trial and that\\'s an important clinical trial which actually will we hope give us definitive evidence that this material really does work,\" she said.\\n\"We may not require any further clinical trials after that to take it to market.\\n\\nVictoria joins MIS tax fight\\nThe Victorian Government has joined the fight to save tax incentives for managed investment schemes (MIS).\\nThe Federal Government is considering a crack down on the tax breaks, which allow investors to claim 100 per cent tax relief from projects like timber plantation developments.\\nVictorian Regional Development Minister John Brumby says the Federal Government needs to consult with stakeholders and clearly outline the proposed changes before pushing through new legislation.\\n\"We\\'ve seen something like $321 million invested in Victoria over the past four years,\" he said.\\n\\nAWB rejects grain analysts\\' price claims\\nWheat exporter AWB has rejected claims prices being offered to growers for their wheat are not high enough.\\nGrain analysts believe national pool prices should be at least $10 dollars a tonne higher because of stronger global prices and small crop forecasts.\\nBut AWB pool manager David Johnson says returns are at a fair level.\\n\"They\\'re not so low, we believe. I mean obviously the pool return at this point in time is forecasting prices out to 2007,\" he said.\\n\"We haven\\'t changed our pricing methodology at all, we are pricing as we normally do.\\n\"We are always vigilant in trying to make our pool return as relevant to the market place as possible.\" \\n\\nDrought impact\\nMeanwhile as the grain industry struggles to produce a winter cereal crop, new data shows the impact the drought has had on the value of agricultural commodities.\\nThe Bureau of Statistics has released its farm commodity figures for 2004-05, which show a $1.4 billion fall in the value of agriculture.\\nAnalyst Nigel Gibson says they show that a drop in production and prices for winter grains was a key contributor.\\n\"The main cause of that was the drop in the value of crops, which fell by 13 per cent to $17.8 billion,\" he said.\\n\\nLower cotton production forecast\\nThe United States Department of Agriculture is predicting higher demand and lower production of cotton around the world over the next 12 months.\\nThat could result in better prices for Australian cotton growers, with global stocks forecast to be down 1.5 million bales by the end of July next year.\\nAustralian farmers are about to start planting their next crop, but Cliff White from Queensland Cotton says they still need to be cautious.\\n\"[The] next few weeks is relatively crucial as the northern hemisphere crop comes off,\" he said.\\n\"The big players of the US, China, and India ... what happens there will very much determine how the price goes, but with the numbers that we have just gone through, that draw down in stock, there is a little bit more potential than we have seen in the last marketing year.\"\\n\\nWheat virus spreads\\nThe destructive wheat streak mosaic virus is rapidly spreading across Western Australia.\\nWestern Australia\\'s Department of Agriculture banned wheat imports from the eastern states earlier this year to try to stop the disease entering the state.\\nThat ban was lifted when it was discovered after the virus was found in a commercial crop.\\nDepartment spokesman Roger Jones says for the first time, the virus is now being found in crops across the wheatbelt.\\n\"It is a very serious disease if there\\'s widespread infection with the virus in young plants, young wheat plants,\" he said.\\n\\nGwydir to disappear in boundary redistribution\\nA big campaign in New South Wales to stop the abolition of the federal seat of Gwydir has failed.\\nThe seat, currently held by former deputy prime minister John Anderson, will disappear at the next election under the latest boundary redistribution.\\nQueensland will gain a seat due to a population drift across the border.\\nFederal Member for Parkes John Cobb says his seat will be a more manageable size, but it will be harder for the MPs in the much bigger seats of Calare and Farrer to service their communities.\\n\"They\\'ve put Tibooburra virtually in the same state as one that runs almost to the south coast or Mt Kosciuszko,\" he said.\\n\"It is a little puzzling.

to focus on water recycling, to recycle some of the water that is still being discharged into Moreton Bay.\\n\"Peter Beattie talks endlessly about his water grid, he hasn\\'t laid one length of pipe yet, to ensure that water is recycled and the answer is also in pursuing the emerging technologies like desalination.\\n\\nFishing industry prepares for $90m license buyback\\nThe fishing industry is

better market access, really, on a worldwide basis,\" he said.\\nAnd Mr Johanns says non-subsidisers Australia and New Zealand are pushing to reduce farm subsidies as well.\\n\\nTamed NT water buffalo head to Aceh\\nThe first shipment of trained water buffalo from the Northern Territory is being exported to the Indonesian province of Aceh today.\\nTo see domesticated water buffalo being lead aboard a giant live export ship at the port of Darwin is quite unusual.\\nBut today, buffalo, along with camels, goats and cattle, were being loaded aboard the Deneb Prima, which can carry 20,000 to 30,000 head.\\nSeven buffalo, six cows and one bull have been specially tamed and trained by Queensland buffalo whisperer Graham Heffernan for remote rural villages in Aceh.\\nAt least 30,000 working buffalo were lost in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, and these seven will pull ploughs, carts and carry heavy loads.\\n\\nPastoralists urged to diversify for future success\\nA gathering of pastoralists in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia has been told they need to diversify to shore up their future.\\nPastoralists have met in Carnarvon at the third Gascoyne Muster to debate climate change, farm

cattle on native pastures in the channel country but there are plenty of times, particularly in South Australia, properties see more droughts than they do as you go further east ,\" he said.\\n\\nYoung farmer of the year considers using prize money for stockfeed\\nTasmania\\'s new young farmer of the year says he might have to use the prize money to buy stockfeed unless it rains soon.\\nHeath Dobson has won $5,000 after proving himself Tasmania\\'s best farmer under the age of 30.\\nHowever he says with Tasmania\\'s continuing dry conditions he might be forced to put the

documents\\nThe Federal Court has ordered AWB to surrender nearly half the bundle of 900 documents it tried to keep secret from the oil-for-food inquiry.\\nThe bitter argument over the documents has stalled the inquiry\\'s investigations for the past three months.\\nIn handing down his orders, Justice Neil Young said his decision focused on three issues: whether AWB had established its claim, whether that claim had been waived by AWB\\'s own internal inquiries and whether any fraud, sham or trickery had taken place.\\nJustice Young said 25 of the documents before him were not legitimate communications between AWB and its lawyers.\\nHe said a further 316 showed AWB had waived its right to keep them secret when it carried out Project Rose and Project Water.\\nThe six documents presented to Justice Young involving the Tigris transaction he described as being brought into existence for an improper and dishonest purpose.\\nJustice Young added another four to this category.\\n\\nDiesel users missing out as crude price drops\\nThe price of petrol might be falling but diesel users are not seeing the benefits.\\nOil companies are believed to be holding off on passing on the benefits of cheaper crude oil prices, which have fallen from a high of $US77 a barrel in early August to $US64.\\nWhile unleaded petrol has fallen by up to 20 cents a litre at the pump, diesel has only fallen 2.2 cents a litre on average across regional Australia.\\nGeoff Trotter from the independent fuel monitoring group, Fueltrack, says oil companies are profiting at the expense of farmers and the transport sector.\\n\\nDry winter impacts on grain crop\\nThe forecast for this year\\'s grain crop has taken another big hit.\\nThe Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource

the canola crop tipped to be the worst in 10 years.\\nBarley will be down 40 per cent and Profarmer analyst Richard Koch says current warm weather across south-eastern Australia could slice another 4 million tonnes off the already low wheat crop.\\n\"There\\'s crops from about Narrabri down through Victoria that are in the balance at the moment and would need further rain to guarantee yields,\" he said.\\n\\nHay exports under cloud\\nA 200,000 to 300,000 tonne shortfall is putting export orders for hay in jeopardy this year.\\nWith dry conditions, forecasts for the oaten hay crop have fallen by half, leaving farmers unable to fill contract orders.\\nOne of the country\\'s largest export companies, Balco Australia, says it will take hay made from failed wheat crops to make up the shortfall.\\nMarketing director Murray Smith says farmers will not make as much money, but at least they will receive a return for their crops.\\n\"It\\'s probably only about $10 a tonne, mainly because a lot of the wheat is bearded and is not exactly what they want, but hopefully for the growers they can get a bit of a yield from their crop,\" he said.\\n\\nDrastic drop in cotton planting expected\\nThe Australian cotton season has begun in central Queensland, although only a quarter of the normal area is expected to be planted.\\nA small band of farmers have started planting crops, relying on unused irrigation water from last season, since there is no new water available this season because of the drought.\\nGrower Hamish Miller says he is hoping for better prices, because of the lower crop estimate.\\n\"I could sit here for hours and talk about the price but I think fundamentally from information that I work with and receive I think the market does look like it will move higher in the short to medium term,\" he said.\\n\\nIrrigators wary about Govt\\'s water licence plans\\nThe New South Wales Government plans to buy water licences off irrigators to help meet its target for environmental flows in the Murray and Snowy Rivers.\\nUntil now the focus has been on finding water savings, but the Government has now called for tenders to sell water on a permanent basis.\\nConservationists have welcomed the move but irrigators in inland New South Wales are wary.\\nGeneral manager of Murray Irrigation George Warne is worried that if the Government buys the water it will push up prices or reduce access to water for irrigators.\\n\"The State Government has moved straightaway from water savings and its now just fully trying to get into the water market,\" he said.\\n\"The governments may have given up, I think they might be coming under some pressure to find the water savings and they\\'ve decided that a more direct approach works.\\n\\nRiver flows reach low levels\\nRiver flows in Tasmania have reached their lowest levels since records began 40 years ago.\\nTerry Leary from the Department of Primary Industries says record low winter rainfall across most of the state has also meant that many farmers have not been able to fill farm dams.\\nHe says it is also unusual that the dry conditions are affecting the entire state, even the usually high rainfall region of the state\\'s north-west.\\n\\nRain helps Kangaroo Is farmers\\nThere is one part of southern Australia that seems to be faring better than most.\\nFarmers on Kangaroo Island off

entitlements\\nWorkers at the Toowoomba processing plant of KR Castlemaine are worried they will miss out on full entitlements if they look for new jobs before the plant closes.\\nThe company is planning to move its small goods processing operation to Victoria, leaving 350 workers in limbo.\\nThe company has offered to help workers wishing to relocate, but Tom Schulz from the Bacon Factory Workers Union says until it formally notifies staff that the plant is closing, workers who leave will not receive full redundancy entitlements.\\n\"The employees haven\\'t been technically advised they are going to be terminated, there is no actual termination notice been given, therefore if an employee was to leave now they would be entitled only to their accruals in the unused leave,\" he said.\\n\\nInternational College aims to reduce skills shortage\\nFarmers in Victoria\\'s Sunraysia region are hoping that an influx of overseas students will help to solve the region\\'s skills shortage.\\nWhen it opens next month, the Mildura International College will provide horticulture training to 100 students from different countries, with a mixture of classroom and on-farm

said.\\n\\nDohne merinos to be sold over web\\nThe Internet is helping graziers in remote rangeland areas buy sheep that can cope with harsh, dry conditions.\\nWith the growing popularity of the dohne merino breed, producers are about to begin selling livestock over the web, with 5,000 lambs from Queensland listed for the first sale in November.\\nGraham Coddington from the eastern states Dohne Breeders Association says the web is particularly useful for farmers who are a long way from the major saleyards.\\n\"See there\\'s a lot of dohnes bred a long way from the markets right up in Queensland and western NSW,\" he said.\\n\"That gives them competition for their product on their property before they (the sheep) leave there, without spending a cent on trucking them somewhere and stressing them all.\\n\"Where they just go straight to where they\\'re destined for, whether it\\'s feedlot, meatworks or breeders.\"\\nMeanwhile woolbuyers from around the world will be able to bid for Australian fibre on the Internet.\\nElders is set to move its global wool auction onto the web for the first time in November to allow more buyers, exporters and mills to compete.\\n\\nFundraising group receives environmental award\\nA Western Australian fundraising group has been awarded a Golden Gecko for environmental excellence after devising a method to recycle black PVC pipe from mine sites.\\nIt is estimated there are tens of thousands of tonnes of discarded black poly pipe lying around outback mining sites in WA.\\nTony Fitz-Gibbon from Ruggies Recycling says the success of the project hinges on transport companies giving their services for free.\\n\"The key to the actual process is the machine that goes out there can be taken out on site and can chop the pipe up into a shredded size, and then we put it in bulker bags and then it is brought back by the transport companies on free backloads,\" he said.\\n\"In Perth, the actual material is then washed and reprocessed, and granulated, and is then made into either new poly pipe.\\n\"Also we can coat the CCA treated pine logs and make posts for vineyards and that sort of thing with the recycled poly.\"\\n\\nMandatory horticultural code of conduct announced\\nThe Federal Government has announced it will implement a mandatory code of conduct for the horticulture sector after grower groups rejected a voluntary proposal.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran made the announcement in the wake of a meeting last week where the National Farmers Federation and grower group AUSVEG rejected a government proposal for a voluntary but legally enforceable code of conduct.\\nDesigned to provide more transparency for growers when it comes to selling their produce, wholesalers have already warned they will take legal action to prevent a mandatory code being implemented.\\nThe Government has flagged growers may have to foot the bill for the cost of implementing the code.\\n\\nGovts urged not to give up world

a more level base where we can compete more openly,\" he said.\\n\"We think the EU needs to open up its markets more, we think the Americans need to take away some of their home supports and the developing countries need to have less exclusions.\"\\nFederal Trade Minister Mark Vaile has put forward a proposal to try to revive the trade talks this week, but it has been dismissed by the head of America\\'s biggest farm group.\\nAmerican Farm Bureau president Bob Stallman says despite his high regard for Mr Vaile, he feels Mr Vaile\\'s proposal for a 5 per cent EU tariff cut, side by side with a $US5 billion subsidy cut is unfair.\\n\"The 5 per cent is not much, in and of itself but if you add in the potential effects of sensitive products and the percent of products there, not counting special products for developing countries, that\\'s not going to compensate us for giving up $5 billion.\"\\nMr Stallman said Mr Vaile\\'s plan sounds good, five and five, but that\\'s about the best that could be said for it - it doesn\\'t meet US WTO goals.\\nVisiting Irish Trade Minister Michael Ahern hopes the world trade talks can be put back on track.\\nMr Ahern says improved market access is a key issue because 90 per cent of Ireland\\'s production is exported.\\nHe says there is room to negotiate the reduction of agricultural tariffs and subsidies, but the United States needs to come to the party too.\\n\\nAWB chief pushes for end to oil-for-food inquiry\\nWith talk of another extension, the head of AWB says the oil-for-food inquiry needs to be concluded as soon as

current crop estimate could fall further.\\nHe says most growers have had enough of the inquiry and, like the AWB board, would like to see it ended as soon as possible.\\n\"It hasn\\'t been a pleasant experience for any of us and it obviously builds on the level of uncertainty in the industry,\" he said.\\n\"We want to move as quickly as possible to give the growers the certainty and assurances they\\'re seeking in relation to the 06-07 pool and going forward.\\n\\nHot winds add to farmers\\' woes\\nHot north-westerly winds which fanned a rash of small fires across Victoria yesterday have also further reduced the outlook for the state\\'s grain crops.\\nTemperatures have topped 32 degrees in some regions over the past few days, drying out already stressed wheat, barley and canola.\\nAgronomists say all of the 1.5 million hectares of crops planted in the Mallee region have been affected, with farmers now looking at harvesting only a third of average yields.\\nDespite a few millimetres of rain overnight, Ouyen farmer Alan Crook says there is now almost nothing left in his paddock worth harvesting.\\n\"We\\'re probably looking at a desperate situation,\" he said.\\n\"We had a bit of rain two weeks ago and I guess everyone had a bit of hope of getting some crop.\\n\\nDry weather impacts on store sheep sales\\nThe number of spring sales of store sheep in Western Australia has halved due to the dry season.\\nWhile the number of sheep being sold for the meat trade has soared in recent months, the amount of sheep being offered to other graziers has dropped off.\\nIn the next 10 days just 28,000 store sheep will be on offer in WA, compared to nearly 170,000 for the same period last year.\\nRecent rain has boosted some regions, but Ian White from

space,\" he said.\\n\\nNew machinery sales down\\nFarmers are spending less money on new machinery, with sales last financial year down by 9 per cent to $1.6 billion.\\nThe Tractor and Machinery Association is blaming the drought for a $150 million fall in the sales of broadacre farming equipment.\\nWith the Henty Machinery Field Days under way in southern New South Wales, TMA executive

they\\'re concerned about their cash flow,\" he said.\\n\\nDairy Farmers Co-op wins homebrand milk contract\\nThe Dairy Farmers Co-operative has won a contract to supply homebrand milk to Coles, Bi-Lo and Coles Express stores across Queensland.\\nThe co-op already has contracts with Coles in South Australia and New South Wales.\\n\\nNT farmers urged to fill out ag census forms\\nNorthern Territory farmers have proven themselves the worst in Australia at filling out the national agricultural census.\\nHeld every five years, the census collects data on the nation\\'s farm production.\\nForms were due back in July, but so far only 60 per cent have been returned from the Territory, compared to 80 per cent elsewhere.\\nValdis Juskevics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) says the aftermath of cyclone Larry in north Queensland shows the value of the census.\\n\"In the hours after the cyclone in March, Government phoned the ABS and asked what did we know about the farmers in far north Queensland, as in the numbers of farms, the type of farms, their production,\" he said.\\n\"Within hours we turned that information around from the 2001 census and the next day, the Wednesday, the Government announced a recovery package for farmers.\"\\n\\nConservation work helping people with depression: study\\nA research project in Victoria has found that working with local conservation

or exporters.\\nThe code is designed to provide greater transparency to growers when it comes to selling produce.\\nThe office of Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has today confirmed the exemptions and says the code will only apply to wholesalers.\\nHead of the Horticulture Australia Council Kris Newton says she can not believe it.\\n\"That certainly hasn\\'t been conveyed to us. We would be bitterly disappointed if that were the outcome and it\\'s certainly not what we\\'re looking for,\" she said.\\n\"I haven\\'t had that information from the Minister or the Minister\\'s office so clearly we would need to talk with them and get a straight story about what\\'s going on.\"\\nWholesalers say they will take legal action if supermarket chains are not forced to comply with the mandatory code.\\nAndrew Young from the Central Markets Association says if the code is anti-competitive, they may take action through the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.\\nHe believes politics affected the decision.\\n\"The Government had decided to work towards an enforceable voluntary code and then at the twelfth hour this major backflip,\" he said.\\n\"So we can only speculate that the National party pursued an outcome and had their way at the end of the day.\"\\nSome growers and wholesalers in the horticulture sector are questioning the need for the code, which they fear will cost them money.\\n\"We have some very strong relationships with our fruit and vegetable agents across Australia,\" Mark Boyd, general manager of Tropical Pines said.\\n\"Those are very mature relationships and very open relationships that have been very successful for us.\\n\"So we\\'ll have to wait and see the detail of the code of conduct and actually wait to see how it will benefit us.\"\\n\"I\\'m probably a little bit disappointed. It is going to add cost to our business and how we do business, it\\'s hard to quantify exactly how much,\" Grant Nicholl, wholesaler business manager with Flavorite tomato marketing said.\\n\\nWTO chief warns of Aust export changes\\nThe head of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) says Australia may have to give up its single-desk export systems to score a win in the Doha round of the world

sugar.\\nBut Federal Trade Minister Mark Vaile has rejected suggestions the single desks are used as trade barriers.\\n\"The reality is that those that fall into that category in Australia don\\'t have any of those trade-distorting elements to them,\" he said.\\n\"But if I could just make one other point.\\n\\nCairns Group fears time running out for reform\\nThe 18 member nations of the Cairns Group are concerned the window of opportunity is closing to secure a deal to reform world farm trade.\\nAt the end of its three day summit in far north Queensland, the group has called on members of the World Trade Organisation to resume talks by no later than November.\\nThe Cairns Group represents countries that rely heavily on agricultural exports, from Latin America to Asia, and include Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada.\\nFor the last few days, the group has been trying to get the Doha round of trade talks back up and running.\\nThe group\\'s chairman, Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile, says the level of ambition has not changed and no-one, not even the US, European Union (EU) or Japan, has hinted they might abort future discussions.\\nBut the group is saying the major players need to be prepared to give more and expect less.\\n\\nJapan looks to limit FTA proposal\\nA proposed free-trade deal between Australia and Japan is looking shaky, with agriculture again

the largest buyers in Australia bidding against each other to take these levels above the normal market for the type on the day,\" he said.\\n\"The finer end of the wool went to 50 cents and higher above its equivalent.\\n\"The middle microns, say 21, 21-and-a-half, it was a good 30 to 50 cents above the equivalent fleece types.\\n\\nFlystrike plagues WA sheep\\nWestern Australian sheep

says graziers can not increase the carrying capacity of their properties and the findings suggest land clearing laws should be more flexible.\\n\"What we mean by increased flexibility is the possibility of exploring for example things like tradeable development rights - that might require exploration of whether or not we can conserve or allow agricultural development to occur in one area if there\\'s increased native vegetation conservation in another area,\" she said.\\n\\nSheep and cattle prices slump\\nPrices for sheep and cattle have crashed in South Australia after massive stock sell-offs last week.\\nAcross many regions a lack of rain has seen pastures dry up forcing producers to sell off livestock early in the season.\\nMore than 100,000 sheep, lambs and cattle went through the saleyards last week, forcing prices down.\\nBruce Redpath from Southern Australian Livestock in Naracoorte has not seen prices so low in years.\\n\"The biggest drop has been on cows I think, where we\\'ve seen cows fall in a week, a hundred to a $150,\" he said.\\n\\nDrought behind yarding increase at Hay sale\\nThe drought is prompting sheep producers in the New South Wales Riverina to send extra stock to the annual spring breeder sales.\\nThe yarding for the Hay store merino sheep sale on Friday was up by 20 per cent to almost 55,000 head.\\nGraham Morphett from the Hay Merino Breeders Association says prices were well down on last year, but held up better than expected in such a dry season.\\n\"The whole sale there was people ready to buy sheep, there was 500 people attended,\" he said.\\n\\nMinister to lobby Govt to extend EC funding to Nullarbor pastoralists\\nAfter months of asking for support, drought-hit pastoralists on the Nullarbor have been told they will receive help in an attempt to receive federal drought relief.\\nWestern Australia\\'s Agriculture Minister Kim Chance made a flying visit on Saturday and told the group he will lobby the Federal Government to extend exceptional circumstances (EC) funding to the area .\\nPeter Brown from Arubiddy Station, who hosted the visit, says many pastoralists have been forced to sell off their sheep and cattle because of the lack of rain.\\n\\nRain lifts Tasmania\\'s spirits\\nThere has been very welcome rain in Tasmania to lift spirits with falls of between 10 and 30 millimetres.\\nThe state\\'s river levels are at their lowest since record-keeping began 40 years ago.\\nThe very dry southern midlands district of Tunbridge received about 30 millimetres, which Greg Powell says was more than some neighbouring areas.\\n\"We\\'ll we\\'re probably praying a bit harder ... but no, no it\\'s been great for the country,\" he said.\\n\"I\\'m a contractor you know and a lot of farmers were putting stock on cereal crops which we wouldn\\'t end up harvesting in the finish, so it\\'s sort of a snowball effect.\\n\\nBiosecurity plan aims to protect mango industry\\nA national biosecurity plan has been developed to protect the mango industry.\\nIt will help orchards to prepare for pest and disease outbreaks.\\nPlant Health Australia\\'s Lindy Hyam says the plan will also help preserve export markets.\\n\\nBee industry insiders blamed for expensive \\'sting\\'\\nBee thieves in Tasmania are making off with thousands of insects, stealing hives and threatening livelihoods.\\nThis year a series of thefts has cost Tasmanian beekeepers an estimated $100,000.\\nMole Creek beekeeper Shirley Stephens has lost hives in the latest \\'sting\\' and says she suspects insiders are at work.\\n\"A hive at the moment, if you take it to pollination, is worth anything from 80 to $100 per hive, but I\\'m afraid it must be from within our own industry that this is happening because John Smith or Joe Blow wouldn\\'t dream of going near a bee hive,\" she said.\\n\\nStations look to unmanned planes over traditional labour\\nRemote control aeroplanes that can monitor stock, fences and water levels are becoming cost competitive with farm labour.\\nThat is the finding of an MLA sponsored project being carried out by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and the Kondinin Group.\\nThe project is looking into technologies that can cut labour expenses on large cattle stations.\\nLes Zeller from the Queensland DPI says unmanned planes will make light work of everyday surveillance tasks.\\n\\nFrost devastates Goulburn Valley fruit\\nFruit prices could be set to rise, with one of Australia\\'s main stone fruit growing regions devastated by a severe frost.\\nVictoria\\'s Goulburn Valley, which is home to the nation\\'s largest fruit processor SPC Ardmona, will lose an estimated $70 million this harvest.\\nIan Bolitho from Fruit Growers Victoria says up to half of the 300,000 tonnes of fruit grown in the region has been wiped out.\\n\"All the apricots have gone, they showing signs of starting to shrivel and drop off now, at least 50 per cent of the plum crop is gone and probably most of the nectarine crop, and probably 50 per cent of the peach crop,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re just assessing on the fresh pears at the moment but they\\'re not looking all that flash either.\"\\nGrowers are now asking why the weather bureau did not give them any warning of the Sunday night frost.\\nAn Internet-based forecasting service was set up in 2003 after a similar frost caused widespread damage.\\nBut there was no warning issued on Sunday night.\\nKevin Parkyn from the bureau says that was a mistake.\\n\"I think the system is a good one. I think it\\'s exceptional,\" he said.\\n\"Unfortunately we missed this case which doesn\\'t look good on our track record.\\n\"As I said it sometimes can be a very fine line particularly with such intense vigorous windy conditions on the Sunday to have it drop out so rapidly is very unusual.\"\\nElsewhere, growers say they do not expect to see major increases in the price of fruit, but believe the market will be affected.\\nSympathetic Queensland grower Pat Wibaux says it is not the first time the weather has caused a disaster.\\n\"It\\'s not something that someone likes to see happen, but it occasionally does,\" he said.\\n\\nCotton growers offered refund if crop ploughed\\nFor the first time in history, cotton growers have been offered a full refund on their seed costs if they are forced to plough in their crop due to a lack of rain.\\nCotton Seed Distributors has developed the drought package to entice farmers to plant over the coming months, knowing they can recoup their costs if the season does not improve.\\nCompany spokesman Adam Kay says the industry needs help.\\n\"One of the things we could do was assist those growers that are wanting to have a little bit of a punt on things this season, putting some cotton in where they haven\\'t got enough water at this stage or maybe when the price isn\\'t that good,\" he said.\\n\\nWater protection effort doesn\\'t go far enough: farmer\\nThe Federal Government\\'s new effort to protect water resources is being criticised for not going far enough.\\nAn Office of Water Resources will be established within the Prime Minister\\'s department to provide and coordinate national water policy.\\nBut Victorian farmer Mark Wootton, whose family has donated $10 million for a new Climate Institute that\\'s been launched today, says the broader issue of climate change needs to be addressed.\\n\\nScientist pushes for more research into NT coral reefs\\nThere has been a call for more research into coral reefs off the Northern Territory coastline.\\nMarine scientist Dr Victor Gomelyuk says climate change and cyclones have decimated some reefs in the Gulf of Carpenteria.\\nHe says corals should be used as an early warning of destructive changes.\\n\"The main threat is actually global temperature rising,\" he said.\\n\"When sea temperature is raised above about 32 degrees it\\'s almost lethal.\\n\"Lots of other marine components of biota will be affected by these elevated temperatures and [there will be] other consequences of this elevated temperature you know.\\n\\nAWB lawyer quizzed about secret documents\\nAn AWB in house lawyer has been reduced to tears at the resumption of public hearings of the Cole inquiry in Sydney.\\nWitness Jessica Lyons has been quizzed about two previously secret documents released to the inquiry by the Federal Court.\\nThe documents from January 2003 show exchanges between Blake Dawson and Waldren\\'s solicitor Hazel Brassington and Ms Lyons.\\nThey discuss changes to the freight arrangements of two wheat contracts for the Iraqi Grains Board.\\nWhen senior counsel assisting John Agius asked Ms Lyons who authorised the change, she told the inquiry she believed it was AWB marketing executive Chris Whitwell.\\nEarlier, Mr Whitwell and former AWB employee Michael Long made an application to keep secret, names of two legal advice documents, claiming their publication would prejudice them and affect the conduct of any possible future jury trial.\\nCommissioner Cole rejected their application.\\nMeanwhile AWB has increased estimated pool returns for this season\\'s wheat crop.\\nGrowers can expected to receive between four and $10 a tonne more.\\nFeed grain has seen the biggest lift, due to strong local demand.\\n\\nBritish company to takeover Perth oil exploration company\\nPerth-based oil exploration company Hardman Resources has agreed to a takeover by British-based Tullow Oil.\\nTullow Oil is offering just over $2 a share for the company, which is known for its offshore oil projects in developing countries.\\nStock analyst Peter Strackensays says the offer has had a positive impact on Australian oil exploration stocks across the board.\\n\"We\\'ve seen quite a few stocks bounce on that - Roc Oil, who shares interest in Mauritania with Hardman and Woodside and has other interests in China and other parts of West Africa,\" he said.\\n\\nUS calls for farm subsidies changes\\nUS Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns is calling for sweeping reforms to farm subsidies to head off a possible new challenge before the World Trade Organisation (WTO).\\nBut a top farm group is opposing the move, in what is shaping up to be a major fight over US farm policy.\\nBrazil has already won a WTO case against US cotton subsidies.\\nNow Mr Johanns says Brazil may strike again.\\n\"What they\\'re after is our marketing loan program and our counter cyclical program,\" he said.\\nBut the American Farm Bureau (AFB) and other groups say they have not heard this and bureau trade adviser Chris Garza says his group warns against premature concessions.\\n\"If we go in and make any changes to the farm Bill now we could get a WTO, in which case, countries could ask us to do more,\" he said.\\n\\nCitrus growers hoping for better orange prices\\nCitrus growers are hoping a fall in the production of valencia oranges will result in better prices.\\nThe national crop is expected to fall by 25 per cent to under 200,000 tonnes due to frost damage earlier this year in South Australia and the Murray Valley.\\nIn the Riverina region of New South Wales, production is tipped to be 90,000 tonnes, down from more than 120,000 last season.\\nPeter Morrish from Riverina Citrus says record prices of more than $2,500 a tonne are being paid for imported orange juice concentrate, so local growers are in a good bargaining position.\\n\"There\\'s discussions going on at the present time in terms of future contracts and that\\'s looking positive on the growers\\' side at this stage, but unfortunately it\\'s a wait and see,\" he said.\\n\\nMiniature greenhouse trial proves effective in retaining water\\nBroad acre farmers in the future could find themselves using hundreds of miniature greenhouses to save soil moisture and improve growth rates in their crops.\\nBronwyn Laycock from the Cooperative Research Centre for Polymers says by stretching clear plastic over seed-beds, growers can create an entire paddock of tiny greenhouses.\\nShe says so far trials have shown the technique is effective at retaining water in dry cropping districts.\\n\"What we\\'re trying to do is put it down over the seed as it is sown and it traps moisture, and traps the heat under the film like a greenhouse,\" she said.\\n\"[It] gives it a better growing environment and also it means that as it is growing, we\\'re capturing all the water that\\'s transpiring, we\\'re capturing the water in the soil so we get a moister soil environment.\\n\\nPM hits out at Murray Darling Basin efforts\\nThe Prime Minister, John Howard, has accused the Labor governments in the eastern states of not doing enough to address the Murray Darling Basin\\'s environmental problems.\\nIt comes as the Commonwealth sets up a new Office of Water Resources, sparking suggestions it is taking steps to take over control of water from the states.\\nBut Mr Howard says he prefers to cooperate with the states.\\n\"But it\\'s got to be collaboration that makes progress,\" he said.\\n\"I\\'m very unhappy with the Murray Darling Basin. I don\\'t think we\\'re going fast enough, I don\\'t think the Queensland, NSW and Victoria has the same interest as South Australia in making progress on that issue.\\n\"And they can\\'t say the Commonwealth is not doing its bit, we put in an extra $500 million out of the last Budget which we weren\\'t really required to.\"\\nAnd 3,000 farmers in Victoria\\'s Wimmera Mallee are expected to be eligible for water tank rebates this year.\\nAs a result of the ongoing dry conditions, Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water will start water carting on Monday.\\n\\nSorghum prices rise\\nAs concerns mount about feed grain supplies across Australia, sorghum prices have jumped nearly 20 per cent in a fortnight.\\nSorghum is a major component of rations for cattle and pigs in feedlots.\\nJim Cudmore, at Kerwee feedlot in southern Queensland, says his feed prices are now rising exponentially and that is already influencing competitiveness in countries like Japan.\\n\"Our customers have been telling us for some time now that we are starting to lose our price competitiveness, in terms of product into that market,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt rejects Goulburn Valley natural disaster calls\\nThe Victorian Government will not be declaring the Goulburn Valley a natural disaster area.\\nFrosts ruined most of the area\\'s stonefruit crops this week, with losses exceeding 300,000 tonnes.\\nGrowers have called on the state and federal governments to declare the region a natural disaster area.\\nThe Victorian Agriculture Minister, Bob Cameron, has rejected the call, but says exceptional circumstances applications from the area will be fast-tracked.\\n\"When it comes to longer term arrangements, the preferable arrangement is exceptional circumstances,\" he said.\\n\\nWesfarmers to build LNG plant\\nWesfarmers is to build a $138 million liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant at Kwinana, near Perth.\\nThe plant will produce 175 tonnes per day of LNG for use in heavy haulage vehicles.\\nTwo power stations will also be built at remote mine sites to provide energy for those operations.\\nConstruction of the LNG plant will begin soon and it is scheduled to be commissioned in early 2008.\\nWesfarmers energy managing director Tim Bult says the company is confident of expanding operations elsewhere in Australia.\\n\\nNext phase of fishing industry buyout set to begin\\nThe next stage of the national fishing industry buyout commences tomorrow.\\nFishing towns are invited to apply for a share of $40 million, to assist them if they are affected by the buyout of 400 fishing licences.\\nBusinesses can seek up to $100,000 each to close down or a quarter of a million dollars to redevelop.\\nFederal Fisheries Minister Eric Abetz says individual businesses and communities have until January 12 to apply for grants.\\n\"Business that can no longer operate at all - they can apply for the business exit assistance, for those that say \\'we can be still be viable if we can tweak our business but we need some assistance\\' well we\\'ve got the business development assistance,\" he said.\\n\"For communities at large, come up with ideas as to how they might be able to develop something which will provide alternate employment then we\\'re willing to assist those communities as well.\"\\nMeanwhile, the Australian Conservation Foundation has called for a worldwide ban on the sale of patagonian toothfish.\\nThe call comes after the New South Wales District Court fined two crew members of a Cambodian-registered ship more than $100,000 for illegally taking the toothfish.\\nDenise Boyd, from the Conservation Foundation, says the penalty is insufficient and shows that the fishery can not be effectively managed.\\n\"By shutting the fishery down and therefore having no legal product on the market it basically means that any product that does turn up on the market clearly does come from illegal, unreported and unregulated sources,\" she said.\\n\\nRally to highlight wool growers\\' frustrations\\nThere is growing frustration about the options being provided to wool growers during the current woolpoll, with a crisis rally to be held next week in the central west of New South Wales.\\nProducers can have a say on the level of wool tax they pay, from zero to 3 per cent.\\nBut Wellington producer Peter Barton says they must also be able to influence how the tax take is used.\\n\\nQld urged to take advantage of new GM technologies\\nOne of Australia\\'s leading experts in genetically modified (GM) crops says Queensland is in an unique position to take advantage of new technologies.\\nQueensland and the Northern Territory have not followed the other states in banning GM crops.\\nThe CSIRO\\'s plant industry deputy chief, Dr T J Higgins, says buyers overseas, such as Japan, are opening up to genetically modified products, despite voicing opposition in the past.\\n\"The ironic thing is our major competitor in Canada produces GM canola, mixes it with the non-GM canola and sells it to Japan very competitively with Australia,\" Dr Higgins said.\\n\"Australia does not get a premium for its non-GM canola in Japan. So I ask myself the question - why are we put at a potential disadvantage to our competitors?\"\\nAt the same time, a group of farmers on South Australia\\'s Eyre Peninsula has called for the state\\'s ban on GM food crops to be lifted, to help beat the problem of herbicide resistance.\\n\\nReport highlights structural issues for Aboriginal pastoral companies\\nA report into the economic viability of Aboriginal pastoral companies in the Kimberley has found they are not structured to deliver sustainable profits.\\nThe report, commissioned by Meat and Livestock Australia, surveyed a third of the 30 stations owned and operated by Aboriginal communities in north-western Australia.\\nReport co-author Peter McEntree says productivity is generally low and stocking rates, and land quality poor, compared to local non-Aboriginal cattle properties.\\n\"One of the key issues and it\\'s really a bit of a structural issue for a lot of Indigenous properties and that\\'s just the issue of scale,\" he said.\\n\\nChile pushes for Australian wine industry cooperation\\nAustralian researchers will soon be sharing information with one of our wine industry\\'s major international

Australia and Chile, need to be working together,\" he said.\\n\\nEducation the answer to reducing road fatalities, say truckies\\nThere is debate in the Northern Territory about whether to introduce speed limits along the Stuart Highway.\\nIt is believed authorities may be considering introducing a limit of 110 kilometres an hour to reduce road fatalities.\\nBut the Australian Trucking Association\\'s Peter Goed says the answer is more education about the risk of fatigue.\\nHe says it would actually be more dangerous to limit the speeds of motorists trying to overtake road trains.\\n\\nDrought predicted to worsen\\nThere is another gloomy forecast today that suggests the drought is set to worsen.\\nThe weather bureau is predicting a hotter than average lead-up to summer right across the country and below-average rain in most of eastern Australia.\\nThe seasonal outlook from October to December says there is up to a 70 per cent chance that northern Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania will be drier than normal.\\nBureau climatologist Blair Trewin says temperatures will be generally higher than normal.\\n\"The outlook is leaning quite strongly towards warm conditions in much of the country both daytime maximum and overnight minimum temperatures,\" he said.\\n\\nDrought takes its toll\\nThe drought\\'s effect is worsening daily.\\nThe winter grain crop in NSW is on a knife\\'s edge and almost half of it could fail without rain in the next seven to 10 days.\\nThe state\\'s Primary Industries Minister, Ian Macdonald, says dry winds and no rain have combined to make the worst conditions possible.\\nHis department is downsizing crop predictions and now expects less than 2.5 million hectares to be harvested, less than half the annual average.\\n\\nHarsh weather\\nIn Victoria, harsh weather is taking its toll on grain crops in the Mallee and Wimmera regions.\\nThe combination of high temperatures and dry winds, followed by frosts, has some growers considering harvesting nothing this year.\\nDepartment of Primary Industries agronomist Rob Sonogan says the damage has been patchy.\\n\"What we\\'re really seeing as an average across the whole zone is somewhere about 30 per cent of average yield expectation and that\\'s daily decreasing,\" he said.\\n\\nPoor season\\nIn WA, the poor season is being blamed for a 23 per cent fall in the number of livestock entered in this year\\'s Royal Agricultural Show which starts in Perth this weekend.\\nThe Royal Agricultural Society\\'s Deane Allen says many farmers will spend their money on livestock feed, rather than taking animals to the show.\\n\"I would suggest, from the sheep point of view, it\\'s been very difficult for people to get feed,\" he said.\\n\\nNRMA rejects petrol companies\\' petrol transport costs claims\\nThe NRMA has rejected claims by petrol companies that transport costs are to blame for higher fuel costs at country service stations.\\nThe head of the motoring body, Alan Evans, has told the Senate inquiry into petrol pricing that consolidation of retailers and outlets means prices will only get higher.\\nHe says petrol retailers must be forced to be transparent about why their rural stations charge up to 20 cents a litre more than city outlets.\\n\"Even the oil companies themselves say three cents a litre would account for the freight costs,\" he said.\\n\"When you look at differentials as we had in the last week between Sydney and Wagga, of nearly 20 cents a litre, 19, you had differentials of 14 between Wagga and Albury on the same day on the average price of fuel, you can\\'t explain it by freight.\"\\nBut there are bright prospects for an alternative fuel.\\nAn Australian company has been awarded $2 million by the United States Energy Department to trial an alternative hydrogen fuel blend for vehicle engines.\\nEden Energy says some American buses will be powered by its hythane mix.\\nHythane blends 7 per cent

12 students and establishing a new trade diploma.\\nMartin Riordan, from TAFE Directors Australia, says student numbers have fallen by 67,000 in the past five years and country institutes in particular are not attractive enough.\\n\"There is massive discrimination within the system against rural and regional [areas],\" he said.\\n\\nNT fishermen reach buyout deal\\nUp to six northern prawn trawling licences may have been bought back by the Federal Government.\\nDarwin fishermen Tony Thiel says he is relieved to have reached a deal in the first round of the national industry buyout.\\nHe has been unable to sell 10 tonnes of banana prawns caught earlier this year.\\nBut Mr Thiel says restructuring would not have been necessary, if the Government had done more to limit imports of cheaper inferior prawns.\\n\"I don\\'t believe they will need restructuring any more. What our problem is, they can\\'t sell the product and that is the main thing now,\" he said.\\n\"They could stop imports. They stopped it in the states, the industry, the fishermen stopped it importing and duping of prawns.\"\\nMeanwhile, Australia\\'s patagonian tooth fishermen have rejected calls to close down the fishery.\\nThis week, two illegal fishermen were fined more than $100,000 for poaching.\\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation says the penalty is no deterrent and a worldwide ban on the sale of the toothfish would be more effective.\\nBut Les Scott from Petuna Sealord says that would punish responsible operators.\\n\\nCompany says SA Zircon grade among best in world\\nMining of zircon in the far west of South Australia is a step closer, with the discovery of what could be the world\\'s richest grades of the mineral.\\nThe Adelaide Resources and Iluka Resources joint venture has announced that the Tripitaka deposit north-west of Ceduna, contains about 650,000 tonnes of zircon, which is used to make ceramics, glass and aluminium.\\nAdelaide Resources chairman Keith Yates values the deposit at about $650 million.\\n\"The zircon content of the heavy mineral component of Tripitaka is in the order of 65 per cent and 65 per cent by world standards is absolutely extraordinary as far as the heavy mineral component of the deposit is concerned,\" he said.\\n\\nAWI happy with current marketing funding\\nAustralian Wool Innovation (AWI) says it is happy with the level of funding for marketing, despite some grower fears that it is not enough.\\nAWI is recommending a 2 per cent levy in the upcoming wool poll which would see $35 million spent on product development and marketing.\\nAWI chairman Ian McLachlan wants to ensure the marketing program is effective before committing more funds.\\n\"If that does work as well as we hope it will, it\\'s not beyond the realms of contemplation to have another poll before the three years is up,\" he said.\\n\\nMilk company to draw up shortlist of buyers\\nA merger or takeover has not been ruled out for one of Australia\\'s

the development of Indigenous pastoral enterprises in the Kimberley has defended the performance of the organisations.\\nA Meat and Livestock Australia report into the economic viability of Aboriginal pastoral companies in northern Western Australia found productivity and stocking rates were generally poor, compared with non-Indigenous owned properties.\\nBut Russell Show from WA\\'s Agriculture and Food Department says the report is too negative.\\n\"The report\\'s accurate but it\\'s not complete,\" he said.\\n\"And in fact in the review it suggests that there are uses, multiple uses that Aboriginal communities want on their properties and that those uses by their nature maybe mutually exclusive but we\\'ve discovered that they\\'re not.\\n\\nBlack wattle tree research may help in greenhouse gas fight\\nNew research into black wattle trees may help the fight against greenhouse gases.\\nScientists at the Victorian Department of Primary Industries are trialling compounds found in black wattle, as part of research on reducing methane emissions from cows.\\nThe compounds are known as \"tannins\" and are being trialled in a new drench that has the ability to change the way cows digest feed.\\nScientist Martin Auldist says previous trials have found the tannins cut methane emissions from sheep.\\n\"Overseas studies have shown that tannins from black wattle can reduce methane emission by about 13 per cent,\" he said.\\n\\nCole blasts AWB for withholding crucial email\\nA furious oil-for-food inquiry Commissioner Terence Cole has blasted lawyers for AWB following the overnight production of a crucial email.\\nAfter an hour-long delay to proceedings, Commissioner Cole entered the court room in a fiery mood.\\nHe demanded an explanation from AWB about how the August 2002 email and its attachments from the head of UK-based Ronly Holdings, to AWB in-house lawyer, Rosemary Peevey, was not produced months ago.\\nA contrite counsel for AWB, James Judd QC, told the commission the email was a crucial document and had it been produced months ago, the length of the Cole inquiry would have been shortened.\\n\\nFlugge admits transport fees knowledge\\nFormer AWB chairman Trevor Flugge has told the Cole inquiry into the oil-for-food scandal he did know about transport fees being paid to a Jordanian trucking company.\\nWhen Mr Flugge stepped into the witness box he indicated he was having trouble hearing senior counsel assisting John Agius QC.\\nThe problem soon cleared and the questioning became robust.\\nMr Agius asked the witness: \"Were you aware in September 2002 that AWB was paying a trucking fee?\"\\nMr Flugge replied: \"Yes, I believe I was.\"\\nMr Agius continued: \"To whom did you believe AWB was contractually bound to paying the trucking fee,\" Mr Flugge answered, \"to a Jordanian trucking company\".\\nBut when Mr Agius quizzed the former AWB chairman about UK-based Ronly Holdings, who funnelled the trucking fee to Alia on AWB\\'s behalf, Mr Flugge told the inquiry he did not know at that time the payments were made through an indirect process.\\nMeanwhile AWB says growers should be reassured by its decision to wear millions of dollars in legal costs relating to the Cole inquiry and the Australian Tax Office.\\nThe Grains Council of Australia previously called on AWB to confirm that growers would not have to pay the bills out of the national wheat pool.\\nAWB\\'s Brendon Stewart says the wheat exporter\\'s corporate division will now shoulder the costs.\\n\"The key decisions that we announced yesterday are around protection the entitlements of the 05/06 pools, the 06/07 pools and importantly the operation of future pools,\" he said.\\n\"In terms of under a trust structure, [it] should give growers all the assurance they need in terms of costs that are going to come out of those pools.\"\\nAWB has also dropped its wheat production forecast to between 12 to 15 million tonnes, based on the poor crop conditions.\\nGrains analyst Malcolm Bartholomaeus says a small winter crop will increase local competition and growers will probably abandon AWB\\'s pools to take advantage of good domestic prices.\\n\\nGold mine set to finally open\\nA massive new gold mine at Lake Cowal in central western New South Wales is finally opening today, 10 years after it was first proposed.\\nEnvironmental

it is not raining.\\n\"Extremely dry, unbelievably dry. We have a wet and dry season like the Top End of Australia, but we have not had rain here now for two months, which is very unusual for the wet season,\" he said.\\n\\nVaile outlines trade achievements\\nOutgoing Trade Minister Mark Vaile says while world trade talks have been disappointing, he has delivered benefits to farmers.\\nMr Vaile is swapping portfolios with Transport Minister Warren Truss today.\\nHe says putting agriculture at the centre of world trade talks, free trade deals with the US and other countries, and forcing Europe to remove some sugar subsidies have been victories.\\n\"Achieving that win saw the EU having to remove the export subsidies from 4 million tonnes of sugar annually and it has seen a significant increase in the global price of sugar,\" he said.\\n\\nMinister says battle ahead to meet China FTA deadline\\nThe Federal Agriculture Minister says Australia has a tough battle ahead to meet the deadline to broker a free trade deal with

ex-Queenslanders, Melbourne Storm.\\nBut there will be no fence sitting in the north Queensland community of Nebo.\\n\"The Broncos are going to win by at least 12 points and I think the reason they\\'ll win is they\\'ll play 80 minutes of football right through it,\" one supporter said.\\n\"I hope the Broncos win but I think the Storm will do it, they\\'re just a tough all-round team,\" another said.\\n\"I\\'ll be with my youngest daughter who\\'s a Melbourne supporter on the night so I\\'ll probably have to go for Melbourne if I want a bed for the night,\" a resident said\\n\"It\\'d have to be the Broncos because their Queenslanders,\" said another.\\nIn WA, AFL supporters are excited about the chances of the West Coast Eagles in their clash against Sydney.\\nThis group of country kids from the state\\'s south reckon the locals will do them proud.\\n\"I reckon they\\'ll win by about five points - three points,\" one said.\\n\"Just win I reckon - about 10 points,\" said another.\\n\\nUte muster extra special for WA couple\\nThousands of people are heading for Deniliquin in southern New South Wales for the national ute muster.\\nIt will be an extra special trip for Western Australian vegetable grower Rob, who will kick off the weekend by marrying his fiance Iris.\\nRob says it was a deep passion and love of utes that brought them together.\\n\"We were going to get married before we come on the trip but then one of our friends decided well why don\\'t you get married at the ute muster,\" he said.\\n\"So we\\'ve organised it for the day before and we\\'ve been down the track a couple of times before and finally we\\'ve sort of met somebody that\\'s got exactly the same interests, she\\'s more into the truck than me at times, and well it\\'s, fun.\"\\n\\nMurray water users warned to expect cuts\\nThe Murray Darling Basin Ministerial Council has released dire predictions about future water allocations in the river system.\\nWith the worst inflows into the Murray River since Federation, high-security water users, who usually receive 100 per cent of their water rights, are being warned to expect cuts in coming months.\\nJo Haw from the local government-based Murray Darling Association says farmers are selling water rights in desperation.\\n\"The bottom line is they are doing it against every ounce of their fibre,\" she said.\\n\"I think people who are putting their water rights on the market now, some of them are very unwilling sellers but they have no choice.\\n\\nWool production drop blamed on drought\\nThe drought is being blamed for an estimated 6 per cent drop in wool production across Australia this season.\\nAustralian Wool Innovation (AWI) says the forecast has fallen 27 million kilograms to 434 million, because of a lack of rain, pasture growth, and the fact that there\\'s no end to the drought in sight.\\nChairman of AWI\\'s production forecasting committee Dr David James agrees it will be a tough season for growers.\\n\"Partly it\\'s due to the fact that feed production will be down,\" he said.\\n\"For example ABARE is forecasting that cereal production levels will be down by about 30 per cent and another concern is in fact the capacity of farmers to provide water to their stock, and on top of that of course there are cash flow factors which will make it difficult.\"\\nThe dry conditions are forcing many sheep farmers to begin their shearing earlier than normal.\\nAnd the bigger supply is hurting wool prices, with the market suffering its biggest drop since April.\\nTony Kidman from Quality Wool says many farmers can not afford to store wool until prices rise.\\n\"We appear to be having less people holding onto wool at this moment, people looking for more of a cash flow with their wool,\" he said.\\n\"I think the drought conditions are forcing people to shear a bit earlier and sell their sheep a bit earlier than they have in the past.\"\\nInternational factors are also affecting wool prices.\\nBill Cowley from the Australian Wool Network says the market drop is disappointing, especially when the Australian dollar is weaker.\\n\"China do most of their business in US dollars and when we see the US currency fall, we would normally see a firm to slightly dearer market here in Australia, but the bids that are coming from the Chinese at this particular time are getting lower and lower, and there\\'s some resistance to the higher price that they are having to pay in the US,\" he said.\\n\\nFarmers urged to talk about problems\\nDrought-affected farmers are being told to swallow their pride and ask for help to get through this season.\\nVictorian rural outreach worker Ivan Lister says more farmers are seeking support than during the 2002 drought.\\nHe says in many cases talking about problems can help.\\n\"The word that we use is stay connected and we try to promote that amongst all the communities,\" he said.\\n\"They\\'ll either be talking to each other in family situations, talking to the neighbour, asking each other how they\\'re going.\\n\"Be aware that a lot of people are suffering at this time and will continue to struggle.\\n\\nRecycling scheme being commissioned\\nTasmania\\'s biggest water recycling scheme is being commissioned today to provide irrigation water to farms and golf courses.\\nMore than 2,500 megalitres of treated sewage water will be diverted from the Derwent River.\\nCity engineer John Stevens from Clarence Council says the $16 million scheme will prevent up to 80 tonnes of nitrogen and 25 tonnes of phosphorous ending up in the river each year.\\nHe says so far 25 water users have signed up but with the current climate outlook, perceptions of recycled water are changing quickly.\\n\\nFresh concerns raised about 3G technology in rural areas\\nNew concerns have been raised about the future of mobile phone services in rural Australia, once the current CDMA network is phased out.\\nDeputy PM Mark Vaile has warned Telstra he will not accept any deterioration in services, once so-called 3G technology replaces the current system.\\nThe system was to provide broadband Internet and other technology but Telstra says initially, the network might not be that advanced.\\nTelecommunications analyst Paul Budde says the 3G system will only be able to provide voice calls.\\n\\nPublisher seeks more flexibility in media ownership law changes\\nAustralia\\'s largest publisher of rural newspapers is calling for more flexibility in cross media ownership rules.\\nThe Federal Government is planning to overturn most of the current restrictions but maintain some regulations in regional areas to ensure a diverse range of media outlets.\\nBut John Fairfax, chairman of Rural Press Limited, wants to see fundamental change.\\n\\nHoneymoon uranium mine gets environmental green light\\nFinal environmental approval has been granted for South Australia\\'s controversial fourth uranium mine.\\nThe SA branch of the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has granted licences for both mining and milling of uranium at the Honeymoon mine west of Broken Hill.\\nConcerns had been raised about potential ground water contamination from the mine\\'s plan to extract the mineral from rock using acid.\\nBut Keith Baldry from the EPA says the process is environmentally sound.\\n\\nNickel price hits record levels\\nThe price of nickel is climbing to record levels as demand increases and global supplies dwindle.\\nThe base metal has doubled in price in the past six months and is now fetching almost $14 a pound.\\n\\nChicken meat import law review prompts health concerns\\nA peak poultry group says important human health concerns have been ignored in a review of the laws governing chicken meat imports.\\nBiosecurity Australia released a draft import risk analysis into imports in June.\\nBut Dr Andreas Dubs, from the Chicken Meat Federation of Australia, is concerned the draft does not exclude countries which use \\'human\\' antibiotics to grow chickens.\\nHe fears it could lead to consumers developing a resistance to the antibiotics.\\n\"In Australia we don\\'t use antibiotics in animals that are primarily used in humans, so, an antibiotic like fluoroquinolone, which is a very important antibiotic as a last weapon in human health, is not allowed to be used in Australia, whereas it has been used in a lot of other countries,\" he said.\\n\\nRain delays sugar harvest\\nToo much rain has delayed the sugar harvest in northern New South Wales.\\nMills are facing a drop in production, with an unusually wet season making crushing difficult and reducing sugar content levels.\\nGreg Petersen from the Condong Mill near Murwillumbah says the harvest could now drag on until early next year.\\n\"This year has been particularly difficult with the amount of lost time we\\'ve had with the wet weather,\" he said.\\n\\nRecent frost hit vineyards\\nWine grape growers in Victoria\\'s high country say their vineyards have been badly damaged by recent severe frost.\\nThe frost, which caused widespread devastation in orchards in the Goulburn Valley, also hit the state\\'s east.\\nGippsland wine grape growers Howard Reddish says he has lost at least 50 per cent of his grapes but it is hard to know the true cost of the damage just yet.\\n\"We\\'re going to have to do something to the vines now to remove the dead and unwanted shoots,\" he said.\\n\\nCountries approve global macadamia association\\nMacadamia nut growers hope a new global body will ensure other countries help to pay for the industry\\'s research and promotion.\\nAs the world\\'s leading producer of macadamias, Australian growers largely foot the bill, but a new global association has been approved by the 25 countries which grow the nut.\\nQueensland researcher Ian McConachie says it will provide better communication and even out the costs.\\n\\nCane toads helping to reduce feral pigs, insect numbers\\nPest animals are having a field day on some farms in the Northern Territory.\\nSouth of Darwin, at Batchelor, one farm is losing at least three tonnes of premium champagne melons a year to dingoes.\\nBut fruit grower David Thompson says the arrival of cane toads has reduced feral pig numbers and insect problems.\\n\"It\\'s a godsend to us in a way because we get a lot of the insects in the garden, because they got a really long tongue on them and they seem to never miss,\" he said.\\n\"When they whip their tongue out they got the insect, that\\'s it. Mainly moths, they will eat crickets and things like that as well.\\n\\nWeed killers suspended because of crop damage\\nAuthorities have suspended the use of 24 weed killers due to concern about the damage they are causing to horticulture crops.\\nKnown as 2,4-D short chain esters, the chemicals are most commonly used to kill weeds in grain crops.\\nThe Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority says despite control measures to stop spray drift, the chemicals can still evaporate and travel long distances.\\nPesticides program manager Eva Bennett Jenkins says chemical companies will need to prove their products are safe but until then the horticulture sector needs to be protected.\\n\\nShearers seek pay rise\\nAustralia\\'s shearers want a 4 per cent wage rise under their federal award.\\nThe Shearers and Rural Workers Union has recommended a new minimum shearing rate of $218.31 per 100 sheep, an increase of around $9.00.\\nShed hand rates would also rise.\\nGeneral secretary John Morgan says members have been issued with common law agreements detailing the new rates and hopes wool growers will be prepared to sign them.\\n\"It\\'s not a great impost on the employers,\" he said.\\n\"Some people have suggested that it\\'s not enough, but at the same time we recognise wool growers aren\\'t getting a fair deal in relation to their wool prices and we understand that.\\n\"But they seem to forget that our people have got to travel large distances to get to their places of employment at great cost and we\\'ve got to be remunerated for our labour and our costs.\"\\nThe industry is refusing to comment on the changes.\\nMeanwhile shearers across Australia are benefiting from a price war for their tools of the trade.\\nThe price of combs and cutters have been cut by up to a third and the price of some new handpieces on the market are half that of established brands\\nQueensland shearing contractor Ian Bateman says he is happy about competition coming from China.\\n\"I think it\\'s a good thing, for the simple fact is, it\\'s like anything else, if anybody gets a monopoly, they just seem to charge or do whatever they want to do and I reckon the third company into the business will definitely make the other companies brighten their foot work up,\" he said.\\n\\nAustralia\\'s highways below standard: survey\\nThe first independent audit of the nation\\'s highways shows half are below standard and may be unsafe to drive on.\\nThe Australian Automobile Association surveyed 18,000 kilometres of the national highway in all states except New South Wales and gave each one a star rating.\\nWorst on the list were the Bruce Highway on Queensland\\'s Sunshine Coast and the Calder Highway in Victoria between Bendigo and Kyneton.\\nThe association\\'s executive director, Lachlan Macintosh, says half of the highways were rated three stars and more likely to cause deaths.\\n\"In a three star road there are still some deficiencies in the road features; poor median protection, perhaps too many intersections per kilometres of road, poorly designed curves, not enough markings on the road,\" he said.\\n\"So those three star roads could be better, we could see some pretty inexpensive treatment to make them better and that\\'s fairly important.\"\\n\\nTelstra to consider objections when deciding on country pay phones\\nTelstra says it can not guarantee that some country communities will not lose their pay phones.\\nThe company says it is permitted to remove some phones which are being underused and has agreement from the Federal Government.\\nBut Jeff Booth from Telstra Countrywide says local objections will be considered.\\n\"Where there are very, very low call rates, like one call per month or something similar, and where it\\'s costing thousands of dollars to maintain a pay phone we\\'d probably use our discretion in that regard,\" he said.\\n\\nTruss expecting to discuss trade issues from Aust\\nAustralia\\'s new Trade Minister Warren Truss says he expects to travel far less than his predecessor Mark Vaile.\\nMr Vaile has left the trade position to focus on transport and domestic issues surrounding the future of the Nationals.\\nMr Truss says he is hoping he can do far more future trade negotiations from Australia.\\n\"It will be necessary to talk to people in other parts of the world but I still regard very much my responsibilities to my own electorate, to the people of Australia as a high priority,\" he said.\\n\\nRot destroys pink lady exports\\nAn unusual fruit skin condition not seen in Australia before is hurting exporters of pink lady apples from Western Australia.\\nThe rot has destroyed about 40 per cent of this year\\'s exports to the United Kingdom and there are fears more could be rejected in a shipment of 800 tonnes of fruit currently on its way.\\nExperts from Australia and the UK say they have never seen browning this early in the season and are trying to find what is causing it.\\nAngelo Logiudice from the WA Apple and Pear Council says it has having a huge impact.\\n\"In real terms 35 to 40 per cent loss after packing is huge losses because you\\'ve already sustained some losses as you are sorting fruit for export packing, so this is going to be huge for growers,\" he said.\\n\\nNT mango growers seek alternative transport methods\\nDespite the Top End\\'s heat and humidity, some growers are considering sending mangoes to market without refrigeration.\\nA shortage of refrigeration trucks means growers might have to consider sending fruit south overnight when temperatures are cooler.\\nThe Horticultural Association\\'s Tracey Leo says it is high risk and will only be used as a last resort.\\n\"We have predicted a shortfall of about 125 vans in the peaks of the season, when melons and mangoes are coming in, in their peak,\" she said.\\n\"You know the trees are coming into higher production, we are going to be looking at higher volumes and the availability of refrigerated trucks in the Territory is always going to be an issue. So any transport methods that we can look into are good.\"\\n\\nReef review recommendations disappoint fishermen\\nCommercial operators near the Great Barrier Reef are disappointed with a recommendation that fishing bans remain in place for another seven years.\\nThe federal review followed industry anger at being banned from fishing a third of the reef two years ago to protect fish stocks.\\nThe review says there should be no change to the ban, which has angered Russell Anderson from the Queensland Seafood Industry Association.\\n\\nRock lobster prices hit 5-year high\\nPrices for rock lobsters in the southern fishing zone have hit a five year high just days after the opening of the season.\\nAlong the South Australian coast from Robe to Port Macdonnell prices range between $40 and $48 a kilogram, nearly $10 higher than this time last year.\\nLionel Carrison, from the South East Professional Fishermen\\'s Association, says supplies are low at this time of year, but the high prices are not expected to last.\\n\"I guess everybody was anxious for new supplies,\" he said.\\n\\nWebsite to help drought-stricken farmers\\nA website is being launched for drought-stricken farmers in Victoria to help each other through the summer.\\nFarmers will be able to use the Internet to advertise available feed or labour with the site expected to be up and running within two weeks.\\nDoug Chant from the United Dairyfarmers of Victoria says the site will put farmers in touch with a wide network of people and resources.\\n\"Basically it will be feed that will be available, farmers that have feed whether it be hay, silage, grain, will have the opportunity of putting it on the web,\" he said.\\n\"Anything to do with helping farmers through these very difficult times, it gives other farmers in other parts of the state the opportunity of being able to help out.\"\\n\\nSheep take over Hay street\\nA mob of 1,500 sheep has taken over the main street of Hay, in western New South Wales this morning, re-enacting boom times in the wool industry.\\nThe sheep are needed for the Australian Shearing and Woolhandling Championships at the end of the week and rather than truck them in organisers have decided to re-live a part of the town\\'s history.\\nShearOutback director Kim Biggs says the spectacle has not been seen for more than 70 years.\\n\\nShearer sets unofficial world record\\nA South Australian shearer has set an unofficial world record by shearing 1,054 merino lambs in 40 hours.\\nGary Hebberman from Jamestown, in the state\\'s mid-north, used the marathon to raise money for his local sporting complex and a childhood cancer charity.\\nWhile previous record attempts have featured cross bred lambs, he chose merinos, because that is what he is used to shearing.\\n\"I was brought up on merinos, so it makes it a bit easier for me,\" he said.\\n\"It is harder, never ever been done in merino lambs before, it\\'s been done in cross breds, so we just went with it, run with it and see how we went. I didn\\'t look back.\"\\n\\nGovt promises major farm policy changes\\nThe Federal Government has promised major changes to future farm policy in Australia.\\nIt has accepted 52 recommendations made by the Corish Report earlier this year, including world trade, biosecurity, food standards, drought preparation and land and water management.\\nThree recommendations were rejected, including tax concessions for rural areas, importing unskilled migrant workers and centralising power over transport infrastructure.\\nDespite those knock backs, head of the review Peter Corish says it is a landmark win.\\n\\nLive cattle exports to Egypt to resume\\nAustralia\\'s peak livestock industry bodies have welcomed an agreement to resume live cattle exports to Egypt.\\nShipments were halted after the broadcast of footage of cattle having their tendons slashed to restrain them at an Egyptian abattoir.\\nThe Australian and Egyptian governments have signed an agreement to track all Australian cattle until they are slaughtered at three abattoirs.\\nAt the abattoir where the cattle were filmed, Minister for Agriculture Peter McGauran says an oversee will be appointed to ensure Australian standards are met.\\n\\nCash incomes for beef producers halved\\nA new report says the cash income for beef producers has been halved in the past financial year.\\nThe Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) says the figures reflect a trend for producers to hold off selling large numbers of cattle in 2005-06.\\nRhonda Treadwell from ABARE\\'S farm survey and analysis branch says producers have been attempting to build up herd numbers.\\n\"Essentially the farm cash incomes have fallen quite considerably and that is mainly because of the incredibly big build up of cattle numbers across a lot of beef cattle properties, so their profit hasn\\'t fallen as much as their cash income,\" she said.\\nBut those attempts to build up herds are now being thwarted by the on-going drought, with producers starting to sell large numbers of cattle.\\nIn north-west New South Wales, producer Graham Wilson says his greatest worry is finding enough water for his cattle.\\n\"We haven\\'t had any inflow into our dams for over 12 months and we\\'re getting very critical,\" he said.\\n\"Our bores on average have gone from about 800-900 gallons an hour down to 200 gallons an hour.\\n\"We need about 40,000 litres of water a day.\\n\\nWool growers unenthusiastic about shearers\\' proposed wage rise\\nWool growers say they are not keen to support a proposed 4 per cent increase to shearers\\' wages.\\nThe Shearers and Rural Workers Union says it has recommended \"modest\" new rates, with a $9 increase per 100 sheep.\\nGrowers will be asked to sign common law agreements to pay the new rates from October 31.\\nBut the executive director of WoolProducers, Greg Weller, says growers need to remember that the rise is not set in concrete.\\n\"They\\'re entitled to be able to put forward a view to their members on what they believe should be the appropriate rate,\" he said.\\n\"And I don\\'t think it\\'s helpful for either shearers, and particularly wool growers, if there\\'s a suggestion that there is some rate out there other than what\\'s actually in the award.\\n\\nNew licences to double SA oil, gas exploration area\\nThe area under exploration for new oil and gas deposits in South Australia will double, after the approval of eight new exploration licences.\\nThe exploration area will increase to 140,000 square kilometres, including the Arckaringa Basin near Coober Pedy in the far north.\\nThe company SAPEX has been awarded the licences and managing director Andrew Andrejewskis says any finds will help other mining projects.\\n\"We\\'re looking at the major resource projects that are occurring in that general vicinity,\" he said\\n\\nChemical ban will see return to old-fashioned farming: grain growers\\nGrain growers say they will be forced to return to old-fashioned and inefficient farming methods, due to a new chemical ban.\\nThe Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority has banned the use of 24 weed killers containing chemicals known as 2,4-D short chain esters, due to concerns about contamination of vineyards and horticultural crops.\\nGarry Hansen from the South Australian Farmers Federation says grain growers will be forced to use more expensive chemicals, which they cannot afford in the current climate.\\n\\nFodder shortage starts to show in key growing regions\\nThere is more evidence of a looming shortage of fodder, due to dry conditions in the nation\\'s key growing regions.\\nThe Australian Fodder Industry Association says apart from the north coast of New South Wales and parts of Queensland hay crops need a good drink.\\nExecutive officer Colin Peace says some grain and canola crops are being baled, but overall production will be down.\\n\"The lucerne hay is going to be like hens teeth because there\\'s not the irrigation water that there was say after the last 02/03 drought,\" he said.\\n\"That would be well into the $200 per tonne on farm.\\n\\nDemand for water tanks increases\\nThe drought is also increasing demand for water tanks from farmers.\\nThey are not being used to collect rainwater, but to hold water being trucked in to properties across Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia.\\nRoss Hendy from Tankworld in north-west Victoria says around 250 tanks are being sold each week, and there is a six-week wait for them.\\n\\nNew irrigation model saving water\\nA water cooperative in Western Australia is being held up as a model example for the irrigation sector.\\nThe Harvey Water Cooperative in south-west Western Australia has replaced open irrigation channels with pipes, creating water savings of about 25 per cent each year.\\nThe saved water is piped to Perth to be used in the urban area.\\nDan Norton has been named Rural Achiever of the Year at the Royal Show for his contribution to the cooperative, and he hopes others can benefit from the project.\\n\"By piping the system and eliminating the irrigation channels you cut those losses by 25-30 per cent, which is [the] world\\'s best practice for an open channel system,\" he said.\\n\\nGlobal demand boosts exports of dairy goats\\nGrowing global demand for dairy products is helping to boost exports of Australian dairy goats.\\nArgentina and Mexico have been big buyers to expand their local goat milk industries.\\nNow demand is emerging from Asia, Yemen and Papua New Guinea.\\nJane Hewlett from Tasmania\\'s Dairy Goat Society says there is a growing acceptance of dairy foods, particularly in Taiwan and China.\\n\"Originally dairy products were not high on their list of food,\" she said.\\n\\nNorth-west WA worried about biosecurity risks\\nIn far north Western Australia, farmers who want to develop new luxury bed and breakfast accommodation in the Ord River irrigation area will now have to take biosecurity risks into account.\\nThe Shire of Wyndham East Kimberley is amending its Town Planning Act to protect the region\\'s agriculture, which is highly regarded because of its isolation.\\nIt is worried about the threat of pests and diseases that could be brought in by tourists.\\nVaughan Davies from Tourism Western Australia says it is the first time biosecurity has played such a major role.\\n\\nAustralian consortium launches new beef marketing strategy\\nA big push into 4,000 Japanese supermarkets has been launched by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) and the Australian Agricultural Company.\\nQantas and Wolf Blass are also joining the marketing strategy, to promote Aussie beef in the lead-up to Christmas.\\nMLA\\'s managing director David Palmer says it is a unique marketing plan to snare ongoing commitment from tough Japanese consumers, and fight off competition from the US.\\n\"It\\'s an initiative to help continue to drive that loyalty, to help to continue to hold shelf space here in the Japanese retail market,\" he said.\\n\\nPollen from feral olives can cause \\'severe respiratory problems\\'\\nThe expansion of olive production across the country could be leading to human health problems.\\nThe Cooperative Research Centre for Australian Weed Management says leaving fruit on trees after harvesting is causing feral olives to spread outside the grove.\\nChief executive Rachel McFadyen says the pollen from feral olives can cause severe respiratory problems.\\n\"Olive pollen is quite a severe allergen, that\\'s to say if people breath it they develop an allergy to it, and then they start to suffer from hay fever and sinusitis and eventually perhaps asthma,\" she said.\\n\\nGovt has no major greenhouse gas strategy: expert\\nA leading climate change expert has told a summit on alternative fuels that the Federal Government has no far reaching strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\\nThe former head of atmospheric research at the CSIRO, Dr Graeme Pearman, says Australia will face growing international pressure to meet targets and it does not have any in place.\\nThe NRMA is pushing for an alternative fuels task force, challenging the Government to fund it.\\nDr Pearman says if politicians do not set aside their electoral aspirations, Australia faces an immediate crisis.\\n\\nEx-NFF boss considers entering federal politics\\nThe former president of the National Farmers Federation (NFF), Peter Corish, has confirmed he is thinking about running as a candidate in next year\\'s federal election.\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the Nationals would welcome the former leader, but Mr Corish says he is yet to make up his mind.\\nHe believes it would be logical to run in the new New South Wales seat which incorporates the seat held by former deputy PM John Anderson.\\nThe National party has welcomed an apparent softening in the Federal Government\\'s plans to allow greater powers for cross-media ownership in rural areas.\\nCommunications Minister Helen Coonan says she is prepared to listen to proposed changes to the new ownership laws, to ensure radio, television and newspapers are not owned by one company in the same region.\\nNationals\\' MP Paul Neville says members are hoping to convince the Minister to protect rural media.\\n\\nFarmers air mining worries\\nThe search for copper, cobalt, nickel and uranium near the Northern Territory town of Batchelor is worrying some local farmers.\\nCompass Resources has revived exploration near the town, originally built to service the nation\\'s first uranium mine, Rum Jungle, in the 1950s.\\nSmall rural blocks have been developed since then, including a commercial vegetable and fruit farm.\\nCompass\\'s community manager Tracker Tilmouth says they have yet to reach agreement over how to share resources, including water.\\n\"Because of where the mine is located we have a very large water supply that we have to de-water, so we will be looking at a whole range of activity that we can complement their water supply or whatever,\" he said.\\n\\nBarrick up-beat about gold price rise\\nThe price of gold has slipped yet again overnight, but the world\\'s biggest gold miner remains confident about the long-term market.\\nBarrick Gold Corporation is standing by its prediction of a gold price of $US700 an ounce by the end of the year.\\nThat is a fair way above the current price of $US566.\\nBut chief executive Greg Wilkins says not enough gold is being produced globally to replace current reserves, which should drive the price back up.\\n\"Clearly one of the challenges for the industry and for the viability is trying to manage the cost,\" he said.\\n\"If gold prices come back down below $500 an ounce it won\\'t take all that long for the supply side to shrink more rapidly than we\\'re seeing today which in turn I think would have positive impact and bring the price back up.\\n\\nBeefed up prices recorded at Rockhampton bull sale\\nAustralia\\'s biggest bull sale has attracted record prices and a clearance rate of 98 per cent.\\nThe sale at Rockhampton, in central Queensland, finished last night, with more than 1,000 bulls fetching nearly $6.5 million over three days.\\nThe top sale of $90,000 was paid for both a grey and a red brahman bull.\\nJohn Croaker from the Australian Brahman Breeders Association says it is the result of years of work.\\n\"They have certainly invested in the breeding herd and the genetics that they are using and it is certainly paying off,\" he said.\\n\\nSA grain harvest begins early\\nThe grain harvest has started two weeks early in South Australia this year because of the lack of spring rain.\\nIan Mudge from Telowie, near Port Pirie, has reaped 300 hectares of peas and barley so far and says despite very low yields, the grain is of reasonable quality.\\nHowever, he says not all of his crops will be worth harvesting and expects to be finished well before Christmas.\\n\"I reckon we\\'ll have most of November and December off. I think it\\'s just one of those years that we\\'ll just chalk up to experience and forget about and zip back next year and have another go,\" he said.\\nOn the far west coast of the Eyre Peninsula, the Thevenard silos has also reported its first delivery of oats.\\nMeanwhile, the estimated value of South Australia\\'s crop production has been slashed to $600 million, about half of what it was last year.\\nThe grim outlook has prompted ABB Grain to close at least two silos over summer.\\nAnd operations manager Peter Weaver says other silos throughout the state could be added to the list.\\n\\nRice growers promised record price to plant\\nAustralian rice growers are being guaranteed a record price of $320 a tonne to plant a crop this year.\\nThe author of a new book on ways to better manage water says all users should have to account for the way they use the resource.\\nJohn Pigram, a Professor of water policy at the University of New England in New South Wales, says farmers have already been forced to improve their efficiency to make the most of low commodity prices.\\nHe is calling for a national audit system to force users to justify their water allocations.\\n\"Whether that be for irrigation, for industry, for a wetland, or a brewery, [they have] ... to be accountable for its use,\" he said.\\n\\nBunnings at centre of grapevine quarantine concerns\\nGiant hardware chain Bunnings could face prosecution for allegedly bringing grapevines into South Australia from a phylloxera risk area in Victoria.\\nPhylloxera, aphid-type insects that attack and kill grapevines, are not present in SA.\\nThe Department of Primary Industries says 122 grapevines were found in four Adelaide Bunnings stores.\\nSpokesman David Cartwright says any breach of quarantine conditions could put the state\\'s $2 billion wine industry at risk.\\n\\nTough conditions may halve Barossa crop\\nSouth Australia\\'s famous Barossa wine region could only harvest half its normal volume of grapes this vintage.\\nA major frost this week has damaged budding vines and comes on top of a lack of rain and reduced water entitlements.\\nBob Taplin from the Barossa Winegrape Growers Association says while lower yields might help to reduce the industry\\'s grape glut, it will not help growers because prices are set to stay low.\\n\\nReduced canola crop prediction may see oil seed imports\\nA forecast of the smallest canola crop in more than a decade has prompted speculation that local crushers will import oil seed from Canada.\\nGrain analyst Malcolm Bartholomaeus says there is likely to be a shortfall between Australian production and customer demand.\\nHe says with canola $90 a tonne cheaper in Canada, crushers might look there to fill the gap.\\n\"One of the considerations is plant utilisation, so importing the canola would be attractive from that perspective,\" he said.\\n\"Also what\\'s the value of the oil coming out and canola oil is reasonably highly priced at the moment, particularly with the underlying biodiesel demand - then you look at the demand and the price that might be achieved for the meal and at the moment there\\'s certainly going to be domestic outlets for canola meal in Australia with the current feed situation out of this drought.\"\\n\\nNumber of rural financial counsellors to be cut\\nRural financial counsellors say they will have to cut staff because the Federal Government\\'s latest round of funding does not go far enough.\\nThe Federal Government topped up funding for the scheme by $10 million in the last Budget and the new program kicked off this month.\\nBut Louise McArthur from the National Association of Rural Counselling Services says a number of counsellors will be lost in every state because the money will only fill funding shortfalls.\\n\"It was slashed hugely, but there\\'s been no negotiation regarding that and I think this has been the big issue right across the country,\" she said.\\n\"That from the regions and the states we\\'ve put in what we think was an applicable appropriate number of counsellors, but we haven\\'t been able to fund that level of counsellors and with the climate change and conditions across Australia our demands are going to become greater not lesser.\"\\n\\nCommercial fishermen finding it difficult to sell boats\\nThe fishing industry is having trouble selling its commercial fishing boats, in the wake of a federal buyback of more than 400 licences around Australia.\\nIn the major southern port of Eden in New South Wales a $2 million vessel is on the market for just $200,000.\\nProcessor and boat owner Titch Rodahl has accepted a buyout package and has sold his boat at 1 per cent of its value.\\nWith the buyout, it\\'s not viable to stay open with the overheads and all that sort of stuff, it\\'s not worth running the boats,\" he said.\\n\"I sort of gave my boat away because I got paid for it in the buyout.\\n\"Three years ago I bought the vessel for $210,000.\\n\\nTas shellfish industry consolidating\\nTasmania\\'s shellfish industry is facing significant generational change, with many family operations selling up or merging.\\nRichard Pugh, the general manager of Shellfish Cultures, says Tasmania\\'s oyster industry is now more than 30 years old and many farmers are reaching retirement age.\\nHe says a cost price squeeze and the difficulties of recruiting new farmers is leading a push towards consolidation.\\n\"Farms [are] just moving towards getting economies of scale,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re finding that we\\'re getting a lot of cost squeezing happening, prices are not rising very quickly.\\n\\nAWB releases grain stock onto domestic market\\nWith many grain crops failing around the country, AWB International has started to release large stocks of grain onto the domestic market.\\nThe feedlot and milling industry have been bidding strongly for the grain, with wheat futures on the Stock Exchange hitting more than $300 a tonne this week.\\nThe chairman of AWB International, Ian Donges, says the company will also open up a number of silos for producers to buy grain for their livestock.\\nMr Donges says AWB still has large supplies of wheat.\\n\"The budget has been around four to 5 million tonnes,\" he said.\\n\"We have got to realise that wheat of course is spread across Australia.\\n\\nGrain growers expecting above average yields\\nWhile grain growers across the country watch their crops die, one small group of growers are set to reap at least average yields, in one of the most unlikely spots.\\nFarms in the Nundroo and Coorabie districts of South Australia, near the Nullarbor Plain in the state\\'s far west, had good summer rains, which were followed up in April.\\nLocal farmer Peter Stott says some paddocks have had above average rain.\\n\"We\\'ll go close to an average season hopefully,\" he said.\\n\"We seemed to have copped a little bit more rainfall here, especially towards the coast.\\n\\nPastoralists appeal for lease payments waiver\\nPastoralists in central Australia are asking the Northern Territory Government to waive their annual lease payments, as they struggle with the prolonged drought.\\nThe Cattlemen\\'s Association says the payments for 12 drought declared stations are worth up to $100,000.\\nThe stations have been unable to receive the Federal Government\\'s exceptional circumstance assistance due to means testing and the absence of specific application guidelines for the Northern Territory desert.\\nVanessa Smith of Newcrowne Station, south-east of Alice Springs, says urgent help is needed to lighten the growing financial burden.\\n\"Everything helps, absolutely everything helps, whether they waive pastoral lease payments, you know anything,\" she said.\\n\"We pay $8,000 for our lease.\\n\"That money could go elsewhere.\\n\\nGovt aims to refocus some drought funding\\nThe Federal Agriculture Minister says the Government hopes in future to refocus some of its drought funding towards helping farmers to be better prepared for dry periods.\\nPeter McGauran says the Government is not planning to withdraw its current drought assistance, but says the most efficient farmers should be supported.\\n\"Don\\'t read into that that we\\'re going to abolish interest rate subsidies,\" he said.\\n\\nHigh quality wool a hit at Sydney, Melbourne markets\\nThe sale of high quality ultrafine wool in Melbourne and Sydney was the highlight of a fairly lacklustre week in the wool market.\\nA top price of 65,500 cents a kilogram was paid at the Sydney sales, with Italian buyers dominating the bidding.\\nOn a wider note, the eastern market indicator fell two cents to 737 cents a kilogram clean.\\nMore than 65,000 bales will be offered next week, including 5,000 bales from New Zealand.\\n\\nRural workers at high risk of sperm DNA damage: scientist\\nThere is a claim today that men who work regularly with pesticides are likely to face difficulties fathering children.\\nA scientist at the University of Adelaide\\'s Centre for Reproductive Health has been researching the damaging affect of chemicals on sperm DNA.\\nDr Michelle Lane says rural workers are in a high risk group.\\n\"We have found a clustering in some occupations with men with high DNA damage and it\\'s often associated with men that might come in to exposure with things such as pesticides or solvents and things like that,\" she said.\\n\\nFarmers brace for locust plagues\\nVictorian farmers are bracing for another summer of locust plagues, with hatchings set to begin this week.\\nThe Department of Primary Industries (DPI) has set up portable work stations so more staff can be sent to wherever the plagues are most severe.\\nDr Malcolm Campbell from the DPI says the need for increased resources was the key lesson from last year\\'s plague.\\n\\nIrrigators accreditation course to help improve image\\nFor the first time, a national accreditation course will be available for irrigators to help improve their image as water users.\\nThe Irrigation Association of Australia has introduced the national industry standard, which covers five minimum skills that people need to work in the sector.\\nFarmers who have taken part in other training schemes can also gain accreditation.\\nChief executive Jolyon Burnett hopes it will reduce inefficient water management practices.\\n\"Many farmers are still scheduling their irrigation by the tried and true old method of wandering out into the paddock, kicking the dirt, having a look to see how moist it is and then making a subjective judgment on how much water to apply,\" he said.\\n\\nCountry people set example for water-smart gardening\\nCity gardeners facing strict water restrictions this summer could learn a lesson from their rural counterparts.\\nFrankie Wilkinson, from the South Australian-based Plant People Nursery, says her rural customers have always made water-smart purchases.\\nShe says while drought is affecting many farming communities, it does not mean their gardens are turning into dust.\\n\"Country people on the whole we find have always watered at night, or first thing in the morning, they\\'ve always mulched and this is something that I think suburban people are beginning to learn and are doing a lot more than they used to,\" she said.\\n\\nRural Australia to wait for access to $1b broadband network\\nTelstra has switched on its new $1 billion mobile broadband network at an investor briefing in Sydney.\\nBut it will be quite some time before all regional Australians can use it.\\nChief executive Sol Trujillo says the network is 100 times greater than any of its competitors and will reach 98 per cent of the Australian population.\\nHowever group general manager of Telstra Country Wide Geoff Booth says full access for rural Australia will not be possible until more towers are built.\\n\"Wherever there is now mobile cover we\\'ll have a broadband product, so we\\'re going to be able to resolve a lot of those so-called dead spots in terms of broadband,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt vows $50m for rural mental health clinics\\nThe Federal Government has offered another $50 million in funding for mental health clinics in rural areas.\\nThe Prime Minister, John Howard, says it will help double the level of access to mental health professionals for country residents.\\nMr Howard says his government will also spend $500 million expanding the Medicare Rebate system, so that more people can get mental health services through GPs, psychiatrists and psychologists.\\nMr Howard says it is part of a $1.6 billion program launched with state governments earlier this year.\\n\"We will be committing some $51.7 million over five years to target areas of need by funding organisations like divisions of general practice and Aboriginal medical services to establish and run mental health clinical services in rural and remote communities.\"\\n\\nDepression fears\\nThe Grains Council of Australia says it is very concerned there will be an upsurge in depression rates as the drought tightens its grip on many states.\\nIt estimates the country\\'s 30,000 grain and mixed farmers will lose an average of $150,000 each on their barley and wheat crops.\\nCouncil chairman Murray Jones is urging farmers to seek help if they are not coping.\\n\"I\\'m sure that this pushes a lot of people to the edge,\" he said.\\n\"These are circumstances which are quite beyond their control and we\\'re just concerned that a lot of these farm families will have some severe psychological effects on this and they need to get help if it\\'s necessary.\"\\n\\nFunding cuts\\nThe cutting of funding to rural financial counselling services across Australia has come in for some strong criticism from a mental health body.\\nState and federal governments have been arguing over the funding, with some states threatening service cuts unless the Federal Government provides more money.\\nProfessor Brian Kelly, from the NSW Centre for Rural And Remote Mental Health, says financial counsellors are irreplaceable during the drought.\\n\"They\\'re the people who are often consulted by farmers about managing the business, managing the pressures they face in farming,\" he said.\\n\\nLandcare conference to focus on climate change\\nClimate change is high on the agenda at this week\\'s International Landcare Conference, which has opened in Melbourne.\\nMore than 1,000 farmers in Landcare, academics and representatives from natural resource groups from Australia and across the globe have converged on Melbourne, for the week-long conference.\\nThe theme for the conference is \"building communication networks to create future landscapes, lifestyles and livelihoods\".\\nTop of the agenda is climate change and the balance between agriculture and the environment.\\nKicking off proceedings today is Land and Water Australia\\'s chairman, Bobbie Brazil, looking at if Landcare is an ancient myth or modern dreaming.\\nLandcare leaders will be recognised for their work at tomorrow night\\'s National Landcare awards, presented by the Governor-General Major General Michael Jeffery.\\nA Canadian environmental lobbyist has told the Landcare conference that Australia would not be in a drought at all, if people used water more wisely.\\nMaude Barlow, who is writing a book called the Global fight for the right to water, says Australians need to change their attitudes towards water saving.\\n\"I think the current drought situation is a reflection of over use and abuse of water,\" she said.\\n\\nHundreds take oil concerns to Canberra\\nAbout a thousand people turned out in Canberra yesterday to send a message to the Federal Government that it needs to take urgent action to address climate change.\\nThe words Clean Energy for Eternity were spelt out across Reconciliation Place.\\nOrganiser Dr Matthew Nott, an orthopaedic surgeon from Bega, says that one of the critical problems facing rural communities, which are dependent on road transport, is oil depletion.\\n\"Petrol\\'s going to become much more expensive in the near future, we\\'re going to be forced to become more self sufficient. and that is going to become more and more difficult as we get hotter and drier,\" Dr Nott said.\\n\\nPerseverance makes $46 mill offer to Leviathan\\nVictoria could host Australia\\'s second largest gold producer following a takeover offer for Leviathan Resources by Perseverance Corporation.\\nThe bid by Perseverance is worth $46 million, valuing each Leviathan share at about 56 cents.\\nPerseverance intends to close Leviathan\\'s Melbourne office and move some staff and equipment from Leviathan\\'s Stawell Gold Mine to Perseverance\\'s Fosterville gold mine, near Bendigo.\\nManaging director Graeme Sloan says if accepted, the offer will deliver big benefits to Perseverance shareholders.\\n\"We\\'ll have the largest landholding in Victoria, very close to 6,000 square kilometres, which is quite extraordinary given the state that the largest is Newcrest,\" he said.\\n\\nMedia law debate on hold\\nA Senate debate on the Federal Government\\'s controversial media laws has been delayed until tomorrow, while Communications Minister Helen Coonan continues meetings with dissenting backbench Coalition MPs and senators.\\nNational party members are also meeting today, after Senators Barnaby Joyce and Fiona Nash indicated they could block the legislation in its current form.\\n\\nPulp mill development headed for courts\\nLandholders opposing a $650 million pulp mill development in South Australia will take their case to the courts.\\nThe development, near Penola in the state\\'s south-east, was conditionally approved by the South Australian Government last month, subject to further checks by the Environmental Protection Agency.\\nLawyer Peter Humphries, acting for 30 landholders, says he will be asking the Supreme Court to review all aspects of the application process.\\n\"There\\'s been no environmental impact study done,\" he said.\\n\\nHobby farmers buy up along cattle route\\nConfidence in the cattle sector is attracting droves of hobby farmers to purchase stock along Queensland\\'s central coast.\\nPeople are snapping up small parcels of former sugarcane farms and are choosing cattle, due to their relatively low maintenance requirements.\\nSmaller saleyards in central Queensland are on track to smash annual yarding records and Elders Livestock Agent, Matthew Lockwood, from Mackay, says he cannot see the trend slowing down.\\n\"As the country gets broken up around the agricultural areas people do find that put a fence up and cattle are pretty easy to handy and run,\" Mr Lockwood said.\\n\\nWA harvest off to early start\\nHarvest has kicked off in Western Australia much earlier than normal because of a dry finish to the season.\\nThe first canola delivery to the state\\'s main grain handler, Cooperative Bulk Handling, was made on the weekend in Esperance.\\nFarmer Gavin Egan says harvest would have been a few weeks later if there had been more spring rain.\\n\"It\\'s been pretty dry here the last three months, pretty well, we were lucky to get a bit of rain at the start of September which pulled us out of it a little bit, but definitely drying off rapidly,\" he said.\\n\\nGrape vines stripped as drought continues\\nIn far western New South Wales, a table grape grower is stripping healthy vines to keep them alive, with the Menindee Lakes system at just 15 per cent capacity.\\nMenindee irrigator Paul D\\'Ettorre says if big rains do not come by March, he faces the prospect of walking away from his family\\'s 60-year-old farm.\\nWhile he expects table grape prices to remain steady for the season, Mr D\\'Ettore says the long-term future is uncertain.\\n\"We will be okay as long as we keep getting the top-up rains, but we keep falling back,\" he said.\\n\\nMango prices drop as harvest picks up\\nThe price of a tray of mangoes has halved in the past fortnight, as the Northern Territory harvest gets into full swing.\\nThe Docking family, who are based on the fringes of Darwin\\'s rural area at Berry Springs, are making the most of drier early build-up weather.\\nIt can be blisteringly hot, up to 35 degrees in the shade, with humidity easily 80 per cent at picking.\\nBut so far, 3,000 trays of mangoes have been plucked from their orchard.\\nThat is compared to 220,000 trays across all of Darwin.\\nStrong winds have scratched the surface of some fruit, increasing the amount of seconds and the early premium prices have already fallen away, to below $30 a tray in the Sydney markets.\\n\\nTassie team takes out shearing championships\\nIn just its third year of competing, Tasmania has won the team\\'s event at the national shearing championships, in Hay, NSW, at the weekend.\\nThe Tasmanians took out the trophy at Hay on the weekend, beating Western Australia by more than 30 points.\\nTeam member Steve Rigby says the island state\\'s success is remarkable, given its inexperience.\\n\"Just three years up and running and to beat you know the other states of Australia that have been competing for a lot longer than we have ... it\\'s a real surprise,\" he said.\\n\"Not only have we got some of the best wool in Australia we\\'ve got the some of the best shearers and shed hands.\"\\n\\nWater sensors may cut irrigation losses significantly\\nAn irrigation expert says multi-million dollar projects using water sensors could cut irrigation losses by between 10 and 20 per cent across Australia.\\nThat is equivalent to all the water used in urban areas.\\nJohn Langford, director of the Water Research Centre at the University of Melbourne, says the first year of trials has been completed and indications are that it could halve the cost of irrigation efficiency programs.\\n\"It involves a unit called a nictor, which would be about the size of a coffee pot, you can dot them around at random in the landscape, so long as they are close enough to each other they will form their own wireless network,\" he said.\\n\\nCouncil seeks funding for annual stored grain survey\\nThe Grains Council of Australia says an annual survey of stored grain is needed to stop livestock farmers panic-buying overseas during droughts.\\nIt wants both federal government research bodies, like the Grains Research and Development Corporation and the livestock industry, to pay $50,000 a year for the survey.\\nGrains Council chairman Murray Jones says livestock farmers need to be made aware that domestic grain is still cheaper than imported grain.\\n\"[The] Grains Council of Australia supports the livestock industry who\\'ve been asking for an indication of a clearer picture of the availability of grain stocks,\" he said.\\n\"I think it\\'s important, both from the livestock industry and from farmers as well, that we have some some record of the greater transparency of the grain at hand.\"\\nMeanwhile the worsening dry in southern and central New South Wales will lead to job losses at Graincorp.\\nThe largest east coast grain handler believes it will only open two thirds of its silos and dramatically cut its casual staff.\\nGraincorp\\'s central regional manager Murray Wilkinson says the company does not have an option but to reduce its costs as the crop dwindles by the day.\\n\\nFarm-related industries bracing for disaster: NFF\\nThe latest Westpac-NFF rural commodity index shows a 1.7 per cent fall on the previous month, amid a drop in beef prices and predictions farm incomes will halve in the coming year.\\nNational Farmers Federation (NFF) vice-president Charles Burke says the figures show it would be short-sighted to dismiss drought as just a problem for farmers.\\n\\nDrought expected to cut cotton production\\nAnalysts are predicting cotton growers this season will plant Australia\\'s smallest crop in nearly 20 years.\\nIndependent Commodity Management\\'s Matthew Leeson says a range of factors, including the drought, will cut production to about 1 million bales.\\nHe says the commodity\\'s subdued price is also significant.\\n\"Compounding the marginal moisture availability is poor price for cotton versus the well above average price for the feed grains due to the shortfall from the winter cereal crop this year,\" he said.\\n\\nFarming region running out of water\\nOne of Victoria\\'s wettest farming regions is running out of water.\\nThe water storage at Leongatha, in Gippsland, is at 24 per cent and falling and residents are on stage four water restrictions.\\nSouth Gippsland Water is auditing local businesses, including the major dairy processing plant Murray Goulburn, to see if their water use can be reduced.\\nMeanwhile oil tankers could ship Tasmanian water to the mainland under a new proposal.\\nEnvironment company Solar Sailer will propose harvesting fresh water from a number of sites in the state\\'s north, when it meets the Tasmanian Government next month.\\nThe company\\'s Robert Dane says selling water to major cities could prove a lucrative industry.\\n\\nWine exports to UK drop\\nAustralian wine exports have slipped to their lowest level in 16 years, with sales to the UK down 3 per cent.\\nThe latest data from the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation also shows the average price per litre of $3.77 was the lowest in nearly a decade.\\nBut cheaper bulk shipments to China are outstripping all other markets, increasing fivefold to 16 million litres.\\nThe corporation\\'s Lawrie Stanford says the wine glut and foreign exchange issues are partly to blame and the outlook is not good.\\n\"The Australian wine sector is clearly oversupplied at the moment and whilst volumes are growing on the back of principally bulk sales, prices are clearly falling as a result,\" he said.\\n\\nFrost decimates Limestone Coast vineyards\\nAfter frosts earlier hit the Barossa Valley, they have now decimated vineyards along the Limestone Coast of South Australia, wiping millions off the value of this year\\'s vintage.\\nThe region that\\'s famous for its full blooded red wines could lose most of this year\\'s grape crop after the temperature dropped below minus three for the second morning in a row.\\nDamage has been most severe in the Padthaway Valley.\\nGrower Ian Ward says he has lost about 90 per cent of his crop.\\n\"I\\'ve got a couple of neighbours who are a hundred per cent affected, I have another neighbour who might be only something like 10 per cent [affected and got off pretty lightly,\" he said.\\n\\nRural doctors push for fly-in, fly-out mental health workers\\nThe Rural Doctors Association of Australia says the federal and state governments need to fund fly-in, fly-out mental health workers to deal with a major shortage in regional and remote areas.\\nIt says the Federal Government\\'s announcement yesterday that it is expanding access to mental health staff under Medicare and setting up new rural clinics will not work if staff can not be persuaded to go to the bush.\\nAssociation president Dr Ross Maxwell says while more psychologists and psychiatrists need to be trained, it still would not be enough to fix the rural shortfall.\\n\\nUrgent talks needed to reassure North Asian trade partners: Opposition\\nThe Federal Opposition says the diplomatic row over North Korea\\'s claimed nuclear weapon test will have to be carefully defused to prevent Australia\\'s trade into North Asia being disrupted.\\nThe Government says it is looking to the UN Security Council to take action against North Korea.\\nThe Opposition\\'s trade spokesman, Kevin Rudd, says China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea buy $70 billion of commodities and products from Australia, and urgent talks are needed to reassure them.\\n\\nScientists pool resources to look at illegal fishing impact on sharks\\nThe impact of illegal fishing upon sharks in north Australian waters is being studied, as part of a new research collaboration.\\nMarine scientists are pooling resources at Darwin\\'s Arafura Timor Research Facility which has cost $3.5 million to build.\\nChief executive officer Stuart Fitch says the laboratories allow advanced genetic fingerprinting of marine material, including seized shark fin.\\n\"This is a genetic sequencing analyser or as most people would probably understand it from CSI on TV, DNA analysis,\" he said.\\n\\nKing Is plantation development ban worries timber industry\\nTasmania\\'s timber industry is worried that a ban on plantation development on King Island will set a precedent.\\nThe chief executive of the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania, Terry Edwards, says he is surprised that the planning policy to prohibit plantations on the island was upheld yesterday after legal scrutiny.\\nHe is concerned other councils will now try to limit plantation development.\\n\"We now have a situation seemingly in Tasmania where councils can tell farmers what crops they can or cannot grow on their land,\" he said.\\n\\nApples may be used to produce ethanol\\nApples could be the next agricultural commodity used to produce ethanol.\\nThe horticulture industry in Western Australia\\'s south-west says unsaleable fruit could be juiced and be turned into biofuel, fetching up to $120 a tonne.\\nAnd Vic Grisotis from Apple and Pear Australia says other fruits could also be used.\\n\"If it\\'s a sugar based product there\\'s no reason why it can\\'t be,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt may extend drought assistance\\nThe Federal Government is considering extending its drought assistance in the face of worsening conditions across many states.\\nIt says the current system was set up to deal with one or two-year droughts rather than the series of dry years farmers have faced.\\nThe federal Agriculture Minister, Peter McGauran, says the Government is worried that farmers in areas where there has been some rain are slipping through cracks in the system, so changes are being considered.\\n\"We don\\'t believe now with the failed spring any of those areas have any possibility of recovery, so rather than wait until they meet another criteria, we should be able to move them straight into drought declaration,\" Mr McGauran said.\\nBut the Opposition\\'s agriculture spokesman, Gavin O\\'Connor, says the Government has been too slow to act.\\n\"Even in EC declared areas, only 13 per cent of farmers have ever accessed these particular provisions.\"\\nThe Government says planned changes will make it easier for areas to become drought declared for EC assistance.\\nIt says they will stop rainfall in one district ruling out help for a whole region and allow EC declarations to last longer than 12 months.\\nThe National Farmers Federation (NFF) says the current drought emergency requires immediate intervention.\\nChief executive Ben Fargher says the politicians are now aware farmers are not whingeing, but looking for targeted measures to deal with the crisis.\\n\"We need to make sure that EC program is working as well as it could,\" he said.\\n\"We would also like the government to consider further changes to EC about some eligibility criteria, lifting caps on interest rate subsidy assistance and some technical matters like that.\\n\\nWheat shortage prompts price spike\\nWorld wheat prices have enjoyed their biggest two-day gain in 18 years on the Chicago Board of Trade, amid global supply concerns as droughts affect Australia, India, Europe and the US.\\nPrices soared 13 per cent to $US5.24 a bushel, the highest level in 10 years before dropping slightly.\\nThe frantic price spike comes after the Grains Council slashed its forecast for the Australian wheat harvest to 12 million tonnes, though American producers believe the Australian crop will be even smaller than that.\\nThe wheat futures rally has been spurred by the massive areas of cereal and canola crops failing in southern and central New South Wales.\\nThese were the comments from producers today from Dubbo through to the Murray River.\\n\"Things have really gone downhill in the last couple of weeks, our deliveries say to Condobolin is probably lucky to get 10 per cent of the normal 150,000 tonnes,\" one producer said.\\n\"Some areas there will be a small amount of grain harvested, probably about 90 per cent of the canola has now been cut for hay and a small proportion of the wheat has been cut for hay,\" said another.\\n\"Very little more than 30 per cent will see a header at this stage, I think people are glossing over just how serious this is, another producer said.\\n\"I know we have got people around here turning there stock in on their crops for the first time in 40 odd years. It\\'s very ordinary.\\n\\nDairy farmers\\' incomes increase\\nAustralian dairy farm cash incomes have increased by nearly a quarter in the past financial year to just over $100,000 a farm.\\nFigures released by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) show Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia performing strongly.\\nBut incomes fell in Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland as the drought pushed up fodder costs and cut milk production.\\nColin Mues, from ABARE, says high prices paid by dairy processors made a big difference to the bottom line.\\n\"The main factor driving that was higher milk prices through improvements in the dairy market,\" he said.\\n\"Production was fairly steady, it went down marginally at a national level but there was a fairly uniform improvement in prices across all states and I think that\\'s been the key factor driving it and the price increases were, you know, between 3 and 5 per cent.\"\\nBut dairy farmers in Western Australia refute ABARE\\'s figures.\\nFarmer John Giumelli says cost of dairying land is so high that profit making is almost impossible, even with better milk prices.\\n\"The attrition rate in dairy farms in WA is absolutely shocking but it\\'s an indictment of what pressure the industry is under and I take no joy out of the ABARE figures,\" he said.\\n\\nEnvironmentalist honoured at Landcare awards\\nEnvironmentalist Rick Farley has been remembered at this year\\'s national Landcare awards.\\nThe award winners were announced last night in Melbourme.\\nOne thousand people flew in from across Australia and as far as Africa to attend the event.\\nEleven awards were handed out to farmers, schools, and shire councils for excellence in land conservation.\\nWestern Australia dominated taking home three awards, New South Wales and South Australia two and one went to Tasmania, Queensland and the Northern Territory.\\nGovernor-General Major General Michael Jeffery presented the ABC with an award for its support.\\nBut for many whose lives were touched by the late Mr Farley, a co-founder of Landcare, it was the dedication of an international award in his name that was the highlight of the evening.\\n\\nACCC urged to investigate alleged price gouging\\nThe NRMA is calling on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate what it alleges is price gouging by Australia\\'s oil companies, as fuel prices fall.\\nNRMA director and former NFF president Graham Blight is meeting National party senators in Canberra today to discuss the issue.\\nHe says claims by the oil companies that they are passing on all of the recent falls in wholesale fuel prices are simply not accurate.\\n\"The Singapore unleaded price has dropped by 29 per cent,\" he said.\\n\"The crude price has dropped 22 per cent. So the difference between what we\\'ve had here is a drop of 14 per cent and the Singapore unleaded is 15 per cent.\\n\\nConfrontation looms over US farm policy\\nA showdown is looming over US farm policy, one that could be even more fierce in the wake of Congressional elections next month.\\nThe Bush administration has been singing the praises this year of cutting farm supports.\\nBut farm state lawmakers are resisting sweeping reforms and opposition could stiffen if Democrats regain control of at least the House amid several Republican scandals.\\nLikely Democratic Agriculture chairman, Collin Peterson, blames US WTO concessions.\\nMr Peterson says he is not going to give up 60 per cent of the US farm program until the EU, Japan and others give up their barriers to trade.\\n\\nZinc price soars\\nThe price of zinc has soared to $US1.66 a pound as world stocks slip to their lowest level in 15 years.\\nZinc miner Zinifex says official stocks are likely to drop to zero next year because of low production.\\nCommodities analyst with the ANZ bank, Andrew Harrington, says tight supply on the London Metals Exchange will push prices up further.\\n\"What they\\'re saying is the official stocks in LME [London Metals Exchange] will probably get very, very low and obviously as they do that prices go up,\" he said.\\n\\nMangoes to be sold in cardboard trays\\nWhole trays of mangoes will be for sale in supermarkets this season.\\nRetailers have demanded the mango packing sheds change over to smaller, black cardboard trays.\\nPacking the new trays means a lot more work.\\nBut Joe Schwarer, a Northern Territory packing shed manager, hopes the trays will sell more fruit.\\n\\nParents warned not to use animal treatments on children\\nThe Australian Veterinary Association is warning parents not to use treatments designed for animals on children.\\nThe association\\'s Dr Matthew Miles says he has heard reports from Victoria of animal flea treatments being used to combat head lice in children.\\nHe says the practice is dangerous.\\n\"There\\'s no safety data whatsoever to describe their use in people and we just don\\'t know what are the effective levels or safety levels,\" he said.\\n\\nGold mine set to reopen\\nA gold mine in far north-western New South Wales that closed more than 100 years ago may reopen.\\nA 700 square kilometre prospect centred on Tibooburra was originally mined from 1880 to 1891 before water shortages and low gold prices forced its closure.\\n\\nRejected bananas may be returned at growers\\' expense\\nMore than 1,400 cartons of bananas from northern New South Wales have been rejected by Victoria and may be returned at the growers\\' expense.\\nGrowers were seeking the better prices from the Melbourne market.\\nBut the $100,000 shipment was sent without the certification needed to ensure it was not ripe and therefore safe from fruit fly.\\nArthur Akehurst, from the Department of Primary Industries, says the actions breach interstate trade regulations.\\n\"This action has endangered the arrangements we have with Victoria but I hope Victoria sees it as a one off and doesn\\'t take further action,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt\\'s training vouchers \\'a positive response\\'\\nRural training bodies have given the Federal Government\\'s plans to give training vouchers to school drop-outs a cautious welcome.\\nPrime Minister John Howard says people over 25, who did not complete Year 12, will be able to use the $3,000 vouchers to pay for vocational courses in TAFEs, federal colleges and private institutions.\\nThe chairman of the Rural Training Council of Australia, Peter Griffin, says the plan would go some way towards easing rural skills shortages.\\n\"It\\'s a very positive response. The skills shortage is a complex issue through rural and regional Australia,\" he said.\\n\\nFirefighters battle blazes in Tas, Vic\\nTasmanian fire services say they have brought under control all 12 bushfires around the state.\\nThe worst blazes are in the state\\'s south, although fires have also been reported on Flinders Island and Cape Barren Island.\\nThere have been no reports of serious property damage but with temperatures pushing 30 degrees, the fire service warns the situation could worsen.\\nIn Victoria, a bushfire burning south of Mt Baw Baw in Gippsland has spread to 300 hectares, driven by strong northerly winds.\\nFifty firefighters are working on the blaze and bulldozers are cutting containment lines to stop its spread.\\n\\nCyclone warning for Top End residents\\nResidents living the Northern Territory\\'s Top End region are being urged to take preparations for the coming cyclone season very seriously.\\nCSIRO surveys have shown tropical cyclone Monica, which hit the Arnhem Land coast in April, devastated a wider area and more vegetation, and brought stronger winds than cyclone Tracy, which flattened Darwin in 1974.\\nResearcher Dr Gary Cook says Monica snapped off trees at the trunk up to 40 kilometres inland.\\n\"The cyclone went past and did a lot of damage in Maningrida, but in the bush there was only about 15 per cent of the trees were snapped off or toppled over,\" Dr Cook said.\\n\"Whereas out where cyclone Monica crossed the coast was closer to 80 per cent that compares to cyclone Tracy with Darwin, where it was only about one third of eucalyptus trees in town were toppled over with cyclone Tracy.\\n\\nBankers \\'not forcing farmers\\' off land\\nThe Australian Bankers Association has defended the banks\\' record in dealing fairly with drought-stricken farmers, following an appeal from Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile.\\nMr Vaile has written to the major banks urging them not to foreclose on farm loans.\\nThe bankers association\\'s rural policy director, Stephen Carroll, says foreclosures are at a historically low level, because farmers are not waiting to be told before deciding to quit the land.\\n\"The banks are not in the business of forcing people to get out of their businesses or to sell assets,\\'\\' he said.\\n\\nClimatologists back farmers on dry weather\\nClimate modelling from around the world continues to support what farmers have believed for years, that it is getting drier.\\nClimatologist Dr Ian Foster, from Western Australia\\'s Department of Agriculture and Food, says there has been a shift to a noticeably drier climate in the south-west of Western Australia and that is set to continue for the next century.\\nHe says that trend is now also coming through elsewhere in Australia.\\n\\nEgg prices set to climb\\nEgg farmers are warning that the drought may force them to increase their prices by around 30 cents per dozen.\\nThe Australian Egg Corporation says egg farmers have been struggling to carry the additional costs of rising grain prices.\\n\\nDNA cattle feed test draws attention\\nQueensland\\'s Gold Coast saw a gathering of 650 people today for Beefex, the Australian lot feeders national conference.\\nThe cost of grain feed is on everyone\\'s lips.\\nThe commercial release of a new DNA test that can identify which cattle are likely to put on the most weight with the least feed has been announced today.\\nCSIRO Livestock Industries and its commercial arm, Genetioc Solutions, took 18 months to identify four genetic markers that influence the feed intake efficiency of cattle.\\nFeedlotters might feed a steer 1.5 tonnes of feed over a 100 days.\\nThe announcement has drawn lots of attention as feed prices spiral across the country.\\n\\nAAC grazing plan proves successful: manager\\nThe nation\\'s largest pastoral house has proved you can graze cattle productively in the outback without fences.\\nThe Australian Agricultural Company (AAC) is using water and herding to control grazing across 500 square kilometres.\\nRockhampton Downs manager Ben Wratten says it has taken two years to change the habits of cattle and so reduce overgrazing.\\n\"We rotate them and alternate them from watering points by shutting off the ones we do not want them to drink at,\" he said.\\n\"We have got hard evidence now that it has definitely made a difference in the recovery of our pasture and we have full crowns of mitchell grass within 200 metres of the trough.\\n\"The cattle are burning a lot less energy to access good bulk feed.\\n\\nWheat ship remains idle\\nA German owned ship loaded with 72,000 tonnes of AWB wheat bound for Sudan remains idle in Port Lincoln in South Australia.\\nFollowing negotiations overnight, eight crew members who went on strike over pay and conditions will now be sent back to the Philippines, leaving the ship anchored in the port.\\nDean Summers from the International Transport Workers Federation says the ship\\'s owners are looking for more crew but it might be hard to attract them.\\n\"I think it will be a couple of days and these guys will be sent home,\" he said.\\n\"We have got to wait for the Filipino seafarers to join it again, so there will be eight more guys coming onto this.\\n\"Although the guys coming on will have to realise that they will be expecting wages about half the already low international minimum, so it would not be a very attractive deal for anybody.\"\\n\\nUS endorsement expected to increase canola oil production\\nAn Australian oilseeds forum has heard that worldwide canola oil production is expected to increase after the US Food and Drug Administration gave its health backing to the product.\\nDelegates at the annual conference in Melbourne have gathered to discuss the world outlook for oilseeds, as well as genetic modification (GM) technology and biodiesel.\\n\\nMining expansion may affect water resources\\nThe coal industry has conceded that water resources may be damaged by rapid expansion of underground mining in New South Wales.\\nSpending on coal exploration in New South Wales has increased by 50 per cent in the last year and many new mines are set to open in the Hunter Valley and the state\\'s north west.\\nChris Moran, from the Sustainable Minerals Institute at Queensland University, says the scientific understanding of underground aquifers and the technology needed to mine around them still haven not been developed.\\n\"The question here is whether we have done the technical engineering research early enough to have effectively worked out the cracking, the surface slumping and started to look at underground techniques that will allow either the cracks to be sealed up or the cracking to be minimised during the process of mining,\" he said.\\n\\nWine cheaper than bottled water\\nA supermarket in Australia\\'s second largest wine growing region is currently selling wine more cheaply than bottled water.\\nIn another sign of the wine industry\\'s plight, the Fisher\\'s supermarket chain in north-west Victoria\\'s Sunraysia area has locally produced cleanskin reds and whites for $2 a bottle.\\nDirector Alan Fisher says he is not cashing in on the difficulties of wine-grape growers in his local community because the only answer to the oversupply will be to move excess stocks.\\n\"There is a huge glut and we have got to get rid of it somehow,\" he said.\\n\"I think what we are seeing is people selling it to people like ourselves to get rid of it as a cleanskin.\\n\\nYoung scientists recognised for innovative ideas\\nUsing aerosol spray to administer vaccine to chickens, harvesting gold from plants and tackling pneumonia in pigs, are among the innovative ideas of 20 young Australian scientists.\\nThe winners of the 2006 Science and Innovation Awards for Young People in Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry were announced last night in Canberra.\\n\\nVic farmers hit out at drought assistance package\\nFarmers have reacted angrily to the Victorian Government\\'s drought assistance package, announced yesterday, saying they have missed out once again.\\nMuch of the $12.5 million package focuses on assistance for communities.\\nAssistance for farmers includes mental health services and counselling, business support and farming advice.\\nGoulburn Valley dairy farmer Dudley Bryant says the days are numbered for farmers unless they get some financial help immediately.\\n\"I think they\\'re treating us like idiots,\" he said.\\n\"They think that we need social workers running around here patting us on the back and telling us that everything is going to be all right.\\n\"And they\\'ve missed the real point, [which] is that farmers and rural communities can look after themselves.\\n\\nWater Initiative has room for improvement: report\\nThe first stage of a national assessment of Australia\\'s water resources has found there is considerable room for improvement.\\nThe Australian Water Resources 2005 report is a baseline assessment of Australia\\'s national water resources conducted by national independent agencies including the CSIRO.\\nIt is designed to show how the National Water Initiative, a blueprint for the country\\'s water reform, is influencing Australia\\'s water resources.\\nIt reveals there is considerable room for improvement and says the state and federal governments need to take firm action to put in place effective water planning to protect river systems and to agree on a national standard for sustainable yields of surface and ground water systems.\\n\\nWater trading plans will damage country towns: Joyce\\nNational party Senator Barnaby Joyce says the Federal Government\\'s current water trading plans will damage the social and economic infrastructure of regional towns.\\nHe has made the comments after a meeting with the head of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, Wendy Craik.\\nThere are plans to take more water for environmental flows and increase water trading across state boundaries.\\nSenator Joyce says the very life of country towns is in jeopardy because their economic prosperity will be traded away with the permanent sale of their water.\\n\"What\\'ll happen is the function of small towns based around irrigation on a sustainable basis will lose their water to other mechanisms that probably don\\'t have the same history, the same infrastructure, economic and social infrastructure based round them,\" he said.\\n\\nDrought behind land value increase\\nClimate change and drought are boosting Northern Territory land values.\\nThere have been 38 sales in the Top End\\'s tightly held pastoral estate over the past five years.\\nLand valuer Frank Peacocke says well over half of the investors are Queenslanders.\\n\"It may level out a little bit, probably when the interest rates take a bit of a turn or the cattle market takes a turn,\" he said.\\n\"But most of them have property somewhere else in Queensland.\\n\\nCereal farmers head north\\nA small group of cereal farmers from northern New South Wales has had enough of drought conditions and has bought some of the wettest agricultural land in the country.\\nThey have purchased cane farms in north Queensland\\'s Tully area, where annual rainfall regularly exceeds 4,000 millimetres.\\nUntil now, Hugh Ball has grown things like wheat, barley, chick peas and dry land cotton, but he says he and a few mates decided to branch out.\\n\"Really there were three fellas sitting round a table and we\\'re all farmers,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re all [from] family driven farms and we were just looking for an opportunity.\\n\"We couldn\\'t do it ourselves so we thought if we team up and use individual expertise this was a logical place to start looking, good rain.\\n\\nOil companies deny collusion claims\\nAustralia\\'s oil companies have told a Senate inquiry they are not colluding with each other to manipulate prices.\\nCaltex is appearing before the petrol pricing inquiry in Canberra today, while BP has also made a submission.\\nCaltex\\'s chief executive Des King says the company only makes a profit of 2.2 cents after tax on each litre of fuel sold.\\nHe has told senators that competition, not collusion, is the main driver for setting petrol prices.\\n\"It is very important to people who operate petrol stations to have high-volume traffic through their station because if somebody finds that if their traffic through their station is low, they will then follow the price down, if somebody\\'s already led the price down, to get their volume back up, because this is very much a low margin, high volume kind of business,\" he said.\\nCommittee member, Senator Andrew Murray, says it is unlikely collusion is taking place between the oil companies.\\n\\nNatural resource management a high priority for farmers: survey\\nA new survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows farmers on average spend 121 days of work, or $28,000 in financial terms, maintaining their properties each year.\\nThe survey of 20,000 farmers between 2004-2005, found Australia\\'s primary producers spent $3.3 billion annually on natural resource management.\\nWhile the grain and beef industries were the biggest spenders, the highest spender per farm was the cotton industry at a $250,000 a year.\\nThe director of environment statistics, David Brereton, says the study identified how much time and money farmers spend maintaining their properties and their environment, and in what ways.\\n\"Out of the $3.3 billion nationally, weed stacked up as the major cost with $1.3 billion or one third of that being spent on weeds, land and soil issues were $900 million and pest issues was $720 million,\" he said.\\n\\nEthanol plant proposal shelved\\nThe Australian ethanol industry has taken another blow, with Bundaberg Sugar deciding to shelve a $20 million ethanol plant in north Queensland.\\nThe company has blamed a lack of ethanol buyers for the decision, but also acknowledges it was unlikely to meet a deadline to qualify for $12 million in federal assistance.\\nCaroline Honan, from leading ethanol producer, the Manildra Group, says the Federal Government must do more for the fledgling biofuels sector.\\n\\nQld Govt to pay farmers to destroy smut infested cane\\nThe Queensland Government will pay cane farmers $2,000 a hectare to plough out and remove sugar cane crops infested by smut.\\nThe long awaited plan of attack comes months after the fungal disease was first discovered near Childers in the state\\'s south-east.\\nSince smut was found in June, surveillance has uncovered it on more than 60 properties, totalling 380 hectares in the Isis and Bundaberg region.\\nIsis Canegrowers chairman Joe Russo says destruction measures will help contain the disease to south-east Queensland.\\n\"I see no point in leaving smut infested blocks out there,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve now identified smut in some of those blocks of ratoon that have been harvested for the 2006 season.\\n\"So it does go to show that we cannot leave it there and let the wind just blow it around.\\n\\nBird flu simulation to test Australia\\'s response\\nThe Federal Health Minister, Tony Abbott, says a four-day bird flu pandemic simulation will test Australia\\'s quarantine and health systems on Monday.\\nHe says the $4 million exercise is the biggest health crisis simulation ever undertaken in Australia and will involve more than 1,000 Commonwealth and state government officials and staff.\\nMr Abbott says part of the exercise will involve a passenger carrying bird flu arriving at Brisbane Airport on Tuesday.\\n\"It will help test our border control, disease detection and surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine and treatment systems,\" he said.\\nAustralian actors, film makers, musicians and the late Steve Irwin have all contributed to increasing sales of Australian wine in the United States.\\nThe industry says they have all helped boost awareness of our country and wine sales to the US have increased in a decade from 2 million to 23 million cases a year.\\nAnd New York based Jan Stuebing-Smyth from Wine Australia says there is still room for the market to grow.\\n\"It\\'s our job to show them the diversity,\" she said.\\n\"They now see Australia as one big place.\\n\\nDrought forces revision of USDA wheat forecast\\nThe US Agriculture Department (USDA) has made dramatic changes to its latest wheat forecast based largely on the unfolding Australian drought disaster.\\nThe USDA knocked down its estimate of Australian wheat production by a whopping 8.5 metric tonnes to just 11 million tonnes in just one month and this has sharply changed US numbers.\\nChairman of USDA\\'s World Agricultural Outlook Board Gerald Bange blames Australia\\'s drought and extreme heat.\\n\"The Australians will not be in the export market the way they would have been otherwise,\" he said.\\n\"As a result of that, we have increased our export forecast today.\\n\"We went up 25 million bushels from our previous forecast.\"\\n\\nWater restrictions yet to be introduced in Broken Hill\\nDespite the critical shortage of water in the Menindee Lakes in western New South Wales, the city of Broken Hill remains without water restrictions.\\nThe lakes system, which supplies the city with all its water, is down to just 14 per cent capacity.\\nBut Country Energy\\'s Brian Steffan says restrictions have not been introduced, partly because of concerns about lead poisoning.\\n\"Broken Hill being situated where it is has significant issues with lead dust, so what we need to do is make sure that we have enough water,\" he said.\\n\"We use more water than other eastern cities [and] towns because we need to make sure that we have water to keep the lead dust down.\"\\nMeanwhile high security irrigators in the New South Wales Murray Valley have become the latest farmers to have their water allocations reduced.\\nAllocations are now back to 80 per cent of entitlement.\\nA similar cutback was made recently in South Australia.\\nThe New South Wales Government says inflows in September were the lowest on record and there has been no October rain so far.\\nThe chairman of the New South Wales Irrigators Council, Col Thomson, says he is not surprised by the decision, which he says will affect many farmers.\\n\"Dairy farmers and those people that haven\\'t had enough water on low security have been very active in the market and a lot of high security have traded down to what they would normally use in a year,\" he said.\\n\\nLocust spraying under way\\nThe WA Department of Agriculture and Food will start spraying for locusts today.\\nNumbers are said to be some of the worst on record and the locusts are getting stuck into what little feed and crops are around in this dry season.\\nDepartment crews, along with farmers, have been surveying farms for some months now and have detected target zones that will be controlled before locusts swarm.\\n\\nKosciuszko bushfire contained\\nA 5,000 hectare bushfire in the Kosciuszko National Park has been contained by weekend rain but it is still a complex operation to put it out.\\nNo property was lost in the blaze but searing temperatures and hot westerly winds swept the flames through new grasslands that had grown where the trees were burnt in the 2003 summer fires.\\nIncident controller Ian Stewart says firefighters will be winched into \"hot spots\" to put out any fires still burning in the rugged country near the snow line.\\n\"Yesterday we had a FLIR [forward looking infra red sensor/laser range] machine come down, that\\'s a helicopter with a forward looking infrared device which picks up hot spots,\" he said.\\n\\nDurum wheat production cut\\nThe dry weather and crown rot disease have forced South Australia\\'s durum wheat production to be cut dramatically this season.\\nDurum is used is making pasta.\\nEstimates are down from last year\\'s 180,000 tonnes to just 40,000 tonnes.\\nMichael Jaeschke, president of the SA Durum Growers Association, says the crop estimates will continue to decline as harvesting begins.\\n\"Unfortunately durum seems to be the first one to go out in a dry season like this,\" he said.\\n\"There\\'s a lot of durum on the ground now that\\'s been cut down for hay and what\\'s left there is really struggling to form any sort of grain.\\n\\nFrost hits Tas orchards\\nTasmania\\'s fruit growers are bracing for heavy losses after frosts hit orchards around the State overnight.\\nThe full extent of the damage will not be known until later in the week, but early reports suggest severe losses of cherries, apricots and apples.\\nSteve Wilson from the University of Tasmania says orchardists in the State\\'s south have been hit hardest.\\n\"Most growers won\\'t be aware of whether they\\'ve suffered any damage until probably late this afternoon or in the next couple of days,\" he said.\\n\\nExercise tests pandemic influenza response\\nBrisbane is hosting a national exercise responding to a suspected case of pandemic influenza.\\nThe exercise follows a simulated outbreak of foot and mouth disease a couple of years ago.\\nQueensland chief veterinary officer Ian Douglas says \"Exercise Consumption\" is the first of its size and scope anywhere in the world but is not directly linked to bird flu.\\n\"Health authorities have been concerned since about 2003 that the H5N1 type of influenza of birds, because there\\'s so much of it about, that it may be the candidate to mutate or change, that it can go in humans and therefore I guess, in the back of everyone\\'s mind, yes that\\'s probably a scenario,\" he said.\\n\\nCompanies may have to look overseas to fill labour demand\\nAustralia\\'s resources sector says it will be difficult to find an extra 70,000 workers over the next decade, estimated to meet its demand for labour.\\nA new report by a nationwide skills shortage working group shows that Western Australia will struggle the most, with the minerals industry there demanding an extra 42,000 jobs.\\nReg Howard-Smith from WA\\'s Chamber of Minerals and Energy says mining companies may have to look overseas.\\n\"I think one of the things that we will have to do is continually look at immigration,\" he said.\\n\"Immigration\\'s not going to be the sole solution by any means, it\\'s across the board and as I say, working with the people that are here.\\n\"But immigration is going to be an important element, I think, if we are to meet these targets.\"\\nMeanwhile Australia\\'s coal industry has been told it needs to properly coordinate its infrastructure needs if it i to reap the benefit of future exports.\\nA report released by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) warns against interstate rivalry over new port and rail facilities.\\nABARE expects coal exports to rise to 435 million tonnes within 20 years, but says it is critical that new mines and infrastructure developments do come on stream.\\nDon Gunasekera from ABARE\\'s minerals branch says despite moves to energy production from sources such as LNG, coal will remain a mainstay of Australian exports.\\n\\nPineapple anti-dumping measures to be expanded\\nThe Australian pineapple industry has had a win against cheap Asian imports.\\nAnti-dumping measures will be expanded over the next five years in a bid to stop cheap processed pineapple being dumped on the Australian market.\\nGolden Circle chief executive John Cook hopes the new measures will improve domestic prices.\\n\\nAust producers may gain ground in US restaurant trade: analyst\\nA visiting US analyst says Australia\\'s reputation for good quality beef could see exporters gain ground at the quality end of the coveted American market.\\nAustralia\\'s disease free status, reputation for quality and the National Livestock Identification Scheme should help Australia sell more beef to the restaurant trade rather than the traditional hamburger market.\\nThe publisher of the US-based Cattle Buyers Weekly, Steve Kay, has this encouraging message for Australian producers.\\n\\nGrazier fined over NLIS breach\\nFor the first time in Queensland, a grazier has been fined for breaching the state\\'s new cattle identification system.\\nThe National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is an electronic system of tags for tracing livestock diseases back to the source.\\nRon Glanville, from the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, says the grazier was taken to court over eight head of cattle that were discovered at Dalby\\'s saleyards without tags.\\nHe says the man was fined $500 but no conviction was recorded.\\n\\nKing Is residents seek wave power study\\nResidents of King Island in Bass Strait are calling for a feasibility study into wave power, in the hope that one day the island could be self-sufficient in electricity.\\nAustralian-developed technology is currently being trialled at Port Kembla in New South Wales but King Island resident David Kerr says he would also like to see it tested off King Island\\'s coast, which is known for its blustery weather.\\nHe says the island\\'s position is ideal.\\n\"We have an active wave climate here on the western side of the island in particular, being at 40 degrees south in the path of the roaring forties,\" he said.\\n\\nGrain companies to feel impact of drought\\nAn agribusiness analyst predicts the unprecedented drought will wipe tens of millions of dollars of profit off key grain handling and marketing companies.\\nAustock predicts Australian winter wheat production will be down 60 per cent on the national five year average to 13.4 million tonnes.\\nAnalyst Paul Jensz says while many key grain businesses have cut costs and rationalised, it will not be enough to curtail the effect of the massive drop in grain volumes.\\n\"Graincorp for instance will be the most impacted, it will have a negative profit of around minus $20 million for 07 in our estimates,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt extends drought support package\\nThe Prime Minister says the Federal Government is extending its drought support package because it is not prepared to let the number of farmers in Australia drop below a critical level.\\nJohn Howard says Australia owes its character and history to its farmers and so the Federal Government is not prepared to let the drought dramatically reduce the number of farms.\\nHe has announced that in 18 already drought declared areas now irrigators, dairy farmers and dryland farmers will be able to claim exceptional circumstances payments.\\nMr Howard has also extended income support and interest rate subsidy relief until March 2008 to take account of the length of the drought.\\n\\nInternational harvests extended\\nLess sugar was traded last week and the prompt March 2007 contract ranged between 11 and 11.87 US/ pound, and settled at 11.71 this morning. Queensland Sugar marketing manager Paul Heeney says some of the other international sugar harvests will be extended. \\n\\nCollinsville mine waiting for final green light\\nAfter 10 years of exploration in the Collinsville area and 18 months of preliminary development, Q Coal Pty Ltd is expecting to start serious construction early next year. Situated in the Charters Towers mining district, the open cut mine is six kilometres south of Collinsville. Managing director Christopher Wallin says the final deadline for community objection to the project is November 8 and they have applied for three, 30 year leases to support the open cut mine.\\n\"We believe that there\\'ll be over 100 jobs full time and during construction of course there\\'ll be several hundred jobs in the construction phase.\"\\n\\nGrain price hikes felt from the trough to the plate\\nIt\\'s going to cost a lot more to put food on your plate, as the flow on effect from a hike in grain continues down the line. As the State\\'s overall supply dwindles, it\\'s not just the bigger agricultural industries like cattle feedlots feeling the pinch, small time producers, egg farmers, bakers, and even coffee shops are being forced to increase their price to keep afloat.\\nFiona Eastwell and her family has just bought an agricultural business near Townsville and while it\\'s too early for them to feel it in the north, their coffee shop and restaurant business in south-east Queensland has seen the consequences.\\n\"We are considering pulling sandwich prices up, meal prices up- just a little of everything over the board because it effects from making pikelets, from buying in gateaus and cakes.\"\\nJeff Ironside owns 12 Oaks Poultry, Townsville and manages 200,000 chooks to supply eggs to a number of businesses. He\\'s seen a huge increase in grain prices, as he buys over 5000 tonnes of grain annually and is looking at a rather dramatic increase in his own prices to maintain a profit margin.\\n\"Normally we\\'re looking to stock up, but there\\'s not a lot of grain on the ground and what there is, is as dear as poison.\"\\nDavid Henderson from Riverina Australia, a grain supplier based in Oakey in south-east Queensland says there is a major shortage of sorghum, wheat and barley, and as their product is sent to agencies all around Queensland can see the whole industry from the paddock to the trough.\\nHe says he hasn\\'t seen a price hike as severe as this before.\\n\\nNFF encourages support for farmers\\nThe National Farmers Federation (NFF) says critics of the Federal Government\\'s extension to its drought support are ignoring economic reality.\\nEnvironmental scientists from the Wentworth Group and the Australia Institute say the $350-million extension to the relief program is encouraging farmers to stay on unviable land.\\nBut NFF president David Crombie says farmers must be supported, so when the drought breaks they are ready to quickly ramp up production.\\n\"I mean Australian agriculture contributes something like $103 billion into the Australian economy, $30 billion in exports, 1.6 million jobs, we\\'re achieving productivity growths of 3-4 per cent. Australian agriculture is very important to Australia,\" he said.\\n\\nPackage welcomed\\nThe exceptional circumstances (EC) extension is very welcome in the grazing country from Canberra south to the Victorian border.\\nFrom Braidwood to the Snowy Mountains, graziers have been destocking and trying to survive for several years on less than half average rainfall.\\nBrian Clifford, from the Cooma Rural Lands Protection Board, says governments cannot do any more now for farmers, unless they can make it rain.\\n\"At least they\\'re recognising that they need the rural industry and it is a one in one hundred or probably worse now,\" he said.\\n\"I think it\\'s great news what they have done and let\\'s hope we get a break in the autumn.\"\\nBut the first stage of the drought assistance package will offer relief to only a handful of Queensland primary producers - about 14 farmers in the North Burnett region.\\nQueensland Farmers Federation executive officer John Cherry hopes future announcements will have more benefits for his members.\\nAnd Western Australian farmers have missed out altogether because a state drought assistance scheme ends at a later date than state aid elsewhere.\\nMeanwhile a prominent Australian researcher says the drought is even worse than most of us think.\\nProfessor Paul Perkins, from the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies at the Australian National University, says our dry conditions are being mirrored in places like the western United States, Spain and Portugal.\\nHe says Australia must learn to produce twice as much food with half the water, to help feed the world.\\n\"It appears that in areas of the Northern Hemisphere, similar to ours, this summer just finishing has been much worse than 2002,\" he said.\\n\"Which means you have got another bad summer coming in Australia, much worse than any since European settlement in Australia.\\n\\nGovt abandons Paradise Dam water tender process\\nA new way of marketing water to irrigators in Queensland appears to have failed.\\nQueensland Government-owned SunWater has abandoned the tender process for the sale of water from the new Paradise Dam in southern Queensland.\\nThe 300,000 megalitre dam, currently at just 13 per cent capacity, is west of Bundaberg on the Burnett River, but its water has attracted only limited interest from irrigators.\\n\\nCane toads may head south with flooding rains\\nIf the drought ends, with the traditional flooding rains, it could introduce an unwelcome pest to the south-eastern states.\\nFrog expert Professor Mike Tyler says cane toads are already present in the southern Queensland areas of the Murray Darling basin and will start moving downstream along the Darling when it floods, possibly as far as South Australia.\\nHe says it is not a matter of if they head south, but when.\\n\"The Murray system itself is really perfect environment for the cane toad,\" he said.\\n\"I\\'m not talking about the major river channel itself but instead the billabongs along the side.\\n\\nIron ore prices forecast to increase\\nThe head of Rio Tinto Iron Ore has forecast an increase in iron ore prices in the next round of international negotiations, due to get under way next month.\\nChief executive Sam Walsh says while the Brazilians settled the price in the last round, Australia is the number two supplier in the world and is in a strong position this time.\\n\"The first part of the negotiations is, in fact, setting the scene, particularly in relation to economics, GDP growth and obviously steel and iron ore usage,\" he said.\\n\\nMine expansion bond not enough: WWF\\nTraditional owners and conservationists have vowed to continue campaigning against expansion of the Northern Territory\\'s McArthur River lead and zinc mine.\\nThat is despite the Territory Government giving the green light for diversion of the tropical river, to allow mining of one of the world\\'s largest ore deposits beneath the river bed.\\nDr Stuart Blanch of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) says the $55 million bond will not be enough to safeguard the Gulf of Carpentaria.\\n\"What can it do if there is major pollution spill into the McArthur?\" he said.\\n\"I have never heard any reasonable technical or engineering proposal that would say for $55.5 million or in that ballpark, this is how we can recapture lead and zinc or other acid or heavy metals that are escaped into the river that have been absorbed by fish or dugong, or turtle and polluted the sediment.\\n\\nFrost hits cherry growers hardest\\nSevere frost has destroyed up to half of this season\\'s fruit crop in Tasmania.\\nIt has been confirmed that cherry growers have been hardest hit, with losses ranging from 30 to 80 per cent, while apple and apricot growers have also reported heavy losses.\\nDomestic shortages are now expected in the coming months after frost also decimated Victoria\\'s Goulburn Valley crop.\\nAnd Gerald Ellis, from the Vineyards Association of Tasmania, says some grape growers expect to lose half this season\\'s fruit.\\n\\nUS vows not to compete over Japanese beef market\\nThe United States beef industry has pledged to try to expand the Japanese beef market, rather than take market share from Australia.\\nAustralia is currently hosting beef producers from the United States, Canada, Mexico and New Zealand for the annual five nation beef talks.\\nThe president of the US National Cattlemen\\'s Beef Association, Mike John, says they would rather grow a contracted Japanese beef market than compete against Australia.\\n\"I don\\'t really look at it as a competitive issue, I think that the entire beef consumption is down in Japan - I mean regardless of where the beef comes from,\" he said.\\n\\nAuthorities monitor European bluetongue virus outbreak\\nAustralian authorities are carefully watching an outbreak of the bluetongue virus in Europe.\\nBluetongue is spread by biting insects and can kill infected livestock.\\nRichard Norris, from Western Australia\\'s Department of Agriculture and Food, says while the virus also exists in Australia a new strain could affect Middle East trade.\\nHe says the latest outbreak has affected more than 700 cattle and sheep on the borders of Belgium, Holland, Germany and France.\\n\"It\\'s mainly affected sheep but it\\'s also made some cattle sick and a few of them have died,\" Mr Norris said.\\n\"Now this is the first time it\\'s been recorded with credibility that cattle have been sick with a particular strain of bluetongue.\\n\\nCommunities feel drought impact\\nA report has revealed 10 per cent of Queenslanders live in poverty and those in regional and remote areas are among the most vulnerable.\\nThe study was carried out by the University of Queensland\\'s Social Research Centre.\\nJill Lang, from the Queensland Council of Social Service, says 400,000 people in the state are surviving on half the average weekly income.\\n\"There are a number of reasons for this,\" she said.\\n\\nCloud juice headed for export market\\nRainwater from Tasmania\\'s King Island could soon become part of a Japanese tradition.\\nKing Island Cloud Juice, as it is retailed, is currently being sought after to make the rice wine - sake.\\nCompany director Duncan McFie says demand for the rainwater is increasing across the world and expansion is likely.\\n\"I had this idea years ago that just as King Island Dairy has a tanker that drives around and picks up all the milk, I had this little cloud juice tanker in my head that drives around and picks up all the water,\" he said.\\n\\nBoxer Bronco Johnson dies at 78\\nAustralia has lost one of the last true boxing showmen, north Queenslander Don \\'Bronco\\' Johnson, who died this week at the age of 78.\\nBronco Johnson earned a reputation throughout Australia for his wild fighting style, his courageous rodeo riding and his Errol Flynn moustache.\\nIn the 1950s and 1960s he led a travelling 10-man boxing and rodeo troupe, taking on all challengers.\\nTroupe member Harry Grogan says it was a tough way to make a living, but he thoroughly enjoyed working with \\'Bronco\\'.\\n\"Any time he fought he used to get the crowd in because they used to love him, the way he would swing at people and hit them from his knees,\" he said.\\n\\nParasitic wasps\\' project secures $4m\\nA research project into parasitic wasps has been awarded $4 million by the National Science Foundation in the United States.\\nProfessor Andrew Austin from Adelaide University will lead the international research to examine and name the thousands of wasp species.\\nHe says wasps are crucial for ecological balance and may be important biological control agents in the future.\\n\\nConcerns govt regulations limiting mining investments\\nThe Western Australian minerals exploration sector claims government regulations are costing the state billions of dollars in lost investments.\\nWA has recorded its lowest ever level of exploration spending, while other states, like New South Wales and South Australia, have almost doubled theirs.\\nJustin Wolawski, from the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, says Western Australia has a reputation as a difficult place to do business due to native title and environmental constraints.\\n\"The mineral exploration and mining industry takes up point zero three percent of the states land mass, it\\'s a minuscule amount of the state,\" he said.\\n\"But what\\'s in front of mineral exploration and mining companies in some cases is approval of both houses of Parliament, approval from the Minister of Environment, and then further impediments alongside there.\\n\\nAbalone farm keen to restock after virus\\nAn abalone farm is attempting to get its business back on track after the discovery of a herpes-like virus on the south-west coast of Victoria earlier this year.\\nPort Fairy\\'s Southern Ocean Mariculture voluntarily destocked three million abalone to prevent the disease spreading.\\nThe company says tests during the past six weeks have shown the farm is now free of the virus.\\nGeneral manager Mark Jervis says an application to move stock back onto the farm needs to be approved by the Victorian Government\\n\\nOld wives\\' tale confirmed, milk helps people sleep\\nIf you have had a few sleepless nights over the continuing dry weather try a warm glass of milk before bed.\\nA Dutch study has found that the amino acids found in milk not only make for a better night\\'s sleep, but also activate a hormone in the brain that makes people more active in the morning.\\nDairy Australia dietitian Maree Garside says it is really confirming what many have known for a long time.\\n\"They\\'re suggesting that being alert in the morning may be due to a good night\\'s sleep and this serotonin, that\\'s produced in the brain is sort of helped along by having tryptophan in your food such as a glass of milk,\" she said.\\n\"This is I guess a bit of research to back up something that we may have known for a while.\"\\nMeanwhile, Victorian scientists have found that the amount of feed a dairy cow eats does not affect its ability to withstand a longer lactation period.\\nResearchers believe extended lactation can makes cow healthier and give farmers better cash flow.\\nDr Martin Auldist, from the Victorian Primary Industries Department, says the finding that no extra feed needs to be bought to sustain a longer lactation came as a big surprise.\\n\\nPossibilities for GM cotton raised at conference\\nNorthern Australian irrigators and researchers have not given up on genetically modified cotton.\\nThe crop has been excluded from the Ord Valley, by the Western Australian Government, and is banned in the Northern Territory.\\nBut growers attending a national irrigation conference in Darwin want to plant it.\\nResearcher John Moulden says trials have proven GM cotton uses less water than existing Ord Valley crops like sugar cane and bananas.\\n\"We are not advocating cotton as the be all and end all for the Ord, it\\'s just one of the options we feel farmers in the Ord really need and deserve,\" he said.\\n\"There\\'s no scientific or environmental reason why GM cotton shouldn\\'t be grown in northern Australia - the issues have been extensively addressed.\\n\\nGovt unveils quarantine changes\\nThe Federal Government says changes to Australia\\'s quarantine system, announced today, will streamline assessment of imports.\\nThe Agriculture Minister, Peter McGauran, says quarantine risk assessment processes will be strengthened by more scientific scrutiny, as well as improved and earlier consultation with importers and farmers.\\n\\nTransporter\\'s business booms as farmers send stock to Tas\\nDesperate Victorian dairy farmers are sending their stock to Tasmania.\\nOne of Tasmania\\'s biggest livestock carting contractors, Page Transport, is bringing up to 40 loads of cattle a week from Victoria, including some dairy cows still in milk, to be agisted on the north-west coast.\\nThe company\\'s operations manager, Chris Page, says it is an unfortunate consequence of the drought that his business is flat out.\\n\"The transport industry in Tasmania will be busier through a drought, which like it or not that\\'s our stance on it, but it is an awful thing,\" he said.\\n\\nPool arrangements \\'don\\'t secure\\' growers\\nThe Grains Council of Australia says new trust arrangements for the national pool, which make AWB Limited the sole beneficiary of the trust, will not protect the financial interests of growers.\\nAWB National Pool Trust Pty Limited has been set up to quarantine the liabilities of each pool within that national pool, starting with this financial year.\\nBut Grains Council chairman Murray Jones says the arrangement does nothing to change the status of growers from unsecured to secured creditors.\\n\"Our legal advice is telling us that because they\\'ve made AWB Limited a beneficiary of the trust then that doesn\\'t really achieve what we aimed to do, which was to ensure the growers and the pool participants were the secured creditors,\" he said.\\n\"Growers today are really focussed on how serious the drought is. They are really doing it tough, and we need to do whatever we can to preserve their equity in this current pool.\"\\nBut the chairman of AWB International, Ian Donges, says the Grains Council has got it all wrong about the new trust.\\nHe says growers will enjoy more financial security, not less.\\n\"The reason we went down the trust path is that we wanted to give pool participants additional protection against any unforeseen liabilities,\" he said.\\n\\nCoalition split over AWB\\'s single desk\\nThe Deputy Prime Minister, Mark Vaile, says a split between Coalition MPs, on whether the single desk wheat export system should be scrapped, is just a symptom of a healthy debate.\\nIn the wake of Cole inquiry evidence about AWB kickbacks to Iraq, up to six MPs including Wilson Tuckey, have called for the end of the single desk.\\nBut Nationals members, including Senator Barnaby Joyce, say it must be maintained.\\nMr Vaile says the Government is considering all the views of MPs and Senators, along with wheat grower groups.\\n\"We really do need to wait until Cole reports, which is about a month away, and have a look at what the recommendations are and what the outcome of the inquiry is and how that affects the whole structure,\" he said.\\n\"We don\\'t want to be making decisions that may be seen as knee-jerk reactions and then have to go through another set of changes if there are particular recommendations coming out of Cole.\"\\nLiberal Senator Bill Heffernan says that, while he supports a single desk, it is debatable whether AWB is the best company to run it.\\n\\nNatural Resources defends water cutbacks\\nThe NSW Department of Natural Resources has defended the way it cut back water allocations to 80 per cent for Murray Valley Irrigators. The announcement on Sunday shocked many farmers because it came without warning. Executive director for water management David Harriss explains it has been a complex issue to work through. He claims they could not flag the cut in entitlement to irrigators because it would have breached commercial confidence. The reductions will apply only to water still in users\\' accounts, and aren\\'t calculated on the full entitlement.\\n\\nAbalone farm \\nA Port Fairy abalone farm has been working hard to get its business back on track after being affected by the abalone virus that affected the south-west earlier this year. Southern Ocean Mariculture voluntarily destocked to prevent the disease spreading further and now has no commercial stock on the farm. The company has been running a sentinel trial for the last six weeks to see if there are still any diseases outside the water of the farm and the results have come back negative. Sarah Farnsworth caught up with general manager Mark Jervis to find out what process is now taking place so the farm can be restocked.\\n\\nFishing licence buyback scheme will secure industry\\'s future: Abetz\\nThe federal Minister for Fisheries, Eric Abetz, says he is confident the Government\\'s fishing licence buyback scheme will secure the industry\\'s future, despite continued illegal fishing in Australian waters.\\nHe is particularly encouraging Bass Strait scallop fishers and northern prawn fishers to apply to have their licences bought out in the second round opening later this month after most of their tenders were unsuccessful.\\nSenator Abetz says significant successes are being made in stopping illegal fishing.\\n\"I think we are slowly but surely getting on top of illegal fishing,\" he said.\\n\"In northern Tasmania, as the time we speak now we\\'ve caught 308 vessels this calendar year.\\n\\nGreens call for climate change inquiry\\nThe Greens are calling on the Federal Government to establish a Senate inquiry into the implications of climate change for the future of Australian agriculture.\\nThe party says climate change could profoundly affect rural communities and is vital to get a clear picture of what steps can be taken now to minimise the impact.\\nThe chair of the Senate\\'s rural and regional affairs committee, Senator Bill Hefferenan, has indicated he will take the Greens proposal to his Liberal partyroom.\\nGreens Senator Rachel Siewert is hopeful there will be enough support for an inquiry.\\n\"We also want to look at what we can do about it, what are the adaptation strategies needed to deal with these impacts on our rural communities to ensure that they are viable,\" he said.\\n\\nUnsold sheep to be taken to the tip\\nSheep could be buried in a pit if they are not sold at a South Australian livestock market.\\nPrices for older sheep are plummeting in the saleyards, with a lack of buyers during the drought.\\nOne of the state\\'s biggest saleyards, Naracoorte, has drawn up contingency plans. Any unsold sheep will be placed in a pit at the local tip.\\nDenis Hovenden from the Naracoorte Lucindale Council says stock agents and the council are trying to prevent unsaleable sheep from coming into the yards. But under the current regulations, stock cannot be returned to their owners if they are not sold.\\nHe says no one wants to put the plan into action, but there is very little choice.\\n\"At this stage it is very much an unknown,\" he said.\\n\\nCompo for Murray Valley irrigators ruled out\\nThe New South Wales Government has ruled out compensation for Murray Valley irrigators affected by water cut backs.\\nHigh security allocations and carry over water in the Murray Valley have been cut by 20 per cent because of record low inflows.\\nThe Natural Resources Minister, Ian Macdonald, says the water will be paid back in future, so there is no need for compensation.\\nHe says more measures to help the farming community will be announced in the next fortnight.\\n\\nDrought dominates National Field Days\\nNew and innovative ways of coping with the drought are the most popular exhibits at this year\\'s National Field Days, currently under way at Orange in central-western New South Wales.\\nAmazingly, the long-running drought has not dampened the spirits of those attending the National Field Days at Borenore.\\nIt is the oldest field days in Australia, running for 55 years.\\nOrganisers say exhibitor numbers and attendance levels are very similar to last year, with 30,000 expected through the sun-drenched gates to the parched earth of the Field Days site.\\nThe hot topics being debated in forums there include managing the risk of climate change.\\n\\nGraincorp backs call for end to AWB wheat export monopoly\\nOne of the nation\\'s biggest private grain traders has backed calls for AWB to lose its monopoly for wheat exports.\\nWestern Australian Liberal MP Wilson Tuckey is spearheading a campaign to dismantle the single desk for wheat exports, in response to speculation that AWB will make significant trading losses this season.\\nTom Keene, managing director of Graincorp, will not directly criticise AWB. But he says growers would do better if other companies were allowed to trade in export wheat.\\n\"It would be wrong of me to comment on the AWB\\'s hedging arrangements,\" he said.\\n\"My reaction has been and continues to be that a marketplace that has more competition in it would ensure that growers could choose who they sell their grain to, just as they currently do with their other grains.\\n\\nEcuador hopeful banana import ban will be lifted\\nEcuador and other banana exporting countries are hopeful the ban on Australia importing bananas from the Philippines will be overturned before the end of the year.\\nThe Australian Banana Growers Council says Biosecurity Australia has changed its position on the issue several times, but it must take account of the dangers of Moko disease in its current import risk analysis.\\nEcuador\\'s Ambassador Antonio Rodas Posso says if Filipino imports get approved, it will make the application process easier for other countries.\\n\"We have heard that you right now, the Australians, are making research on another kind of banana from another country,\" he said.\\n\\nIncidence of breast cancer higher in rural women: UK study\\nA British study has found that rural women are three times more likely to suffer from breast cancer.\\nBut Australian researchers say this contradicts with their findings, which indicate the incidence of breast cancer is highest in cities.\\nJohn Harding, head of the health register and cancer monitoring unit at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, says the statistics show that women in remote Indigenous communities have the lowest incidence of breast cancer.\\n\"There is a protective effect for breast cancer for women who have children earlier and then breast feed for long periods of time,\" he said.\\n\\nCherry research, development levy increases\\nAustralia\\'s cherry growers have voted to increase their research and development levy by three cents.\\nThey will now contribute four cents per kilogram, with the industry expecting to raise about $280,000 a year.\\nThe secretary of the Cherry Growers Association, Trevor Ranford, says the rise is long overdue.\\n\\nCattle, sheep export deaths rise\\nThe numbers of cattle and sheep deaths in export shipments has risen slightly in the first six months of this year, compared to the same period last year.\\nDepartment of Agriculture reports tabled in the Senate say cattle deaths rose from 1.3 in 1,000 to 1.4.\\nSheep deaths rose from six in 1,000 to eight.\\nDeaths of goats rose from 11 in 1,000 to 13.\\nBut the federal Agriculture Minister, Peter McGauran, says animal management measures at ports and on live export ships have improved dramatically.\\n\"Especially the inspections at the feedlot and also before the stock board the ship, in transit where there\\'s a requirement for a vet, reporting daily back to AQIS, with the oversight of an experienced stockman, the improved feed and watering systems [and] the best ships in the world,\" he said.\\n\\nUranium industry heavily regulated: ERA chief\\nThe head of the Ranger uranium mine in the Northern Territory says new entrants to the uranium industry should prepare themselves for zealous government regulation.\\nHarry Kenyon-Slaney, the CEO of Energy Resources Australia (ERA) which runs Ranger, says his mine is one of the most stringently regulated in the world.\\nHe says the red tape comes at a price and is definitely not for mining companies who want to cut corners.\\n\"Frankly, uranium mining is just like any other mining,\" he said.\\n\"It has some specific issues that need to be managed, just as ... other different mining operations do.\\n\\nDrought may affect dairy foods supply, exporter says\\nA Victorian-based exporter and processor of dairy foods has told a conference in Sydney that Japan is concerned about Australia\\'s capacity to ensure long-term supply because of the drought.\\nBurra Foods says Australia exports nearly $23 billion of food and beverages a year, with Japan taking 20 per cent of that.\\nBut chief executive Grant Crothers says while Japan has been a loyal customer of Australia for two decades, it is now worried about the continuing dry conditions.\\n\"Security of supply for any country that can\\'t feed themselves is a big issue and their self-sufficiency on food is down to about 40 per cent and they know they need to buy food outside Japan,\" he said.\\n\\nSenate committee backs guest worker scheme rejection\\nA Senate inquiry has rejected farmers\\' arguments that Pacific islands guest workers should be allowed in to ease a national shortage of harvest labour.\\nThe Senate committee\\'s report supports the Federal Government\\'s view that a new visa is not needed for seasonal farm workers.\\nInquiry chairwoman Judith Troeth says extensive hearings suggested farmers could find Australian harvest labour if they paid better wages and offered adequate working conditions and accommodation.\\n\"The guarantees that we were given that there would be suitable accommodation and enough work for labourers coming in Australia - the confidence there was probably misplaced,\" the Victorian Liberal Senator said.\\n\"Experienced pickers who are Australian told us that it is often quite difficult to get a good wage on the present piece rate that exists.\"\\nThe body representing fruit and vegetable growers in north-west Australia is furious about the inquiry\\'s findings.\\nDavid McKerrell from the Kimberley Primary Industries Association says it is not pay and conditions that are putting workers off in Kununurra in north-west Western Australia, it is the heat.\\nHe says many farmers in the district already pay above award wages but it is not helping.\\nMr McKerrell wants the Federal Government to make exceptions to allow Pacific Islanders to work in hotter climates like the Kimberley.\\n\"Up in Kununurra at present, when it\\'s 38 degrees everyday, it\\'s not pleasant working,\" he said.\\n\"And if these people were around that Senator Troth says there are, surely they would be here.\\n\"There\\'s mangoes here dropping on the ground.\\n\"There\\'s no one available and they\\'re not here, and the reason they\\'re not here is because it\\'s too hot.\\n\"They\\'re not acclimatised to it and that\\'s the end of the story.\"\\nIsis Shire Mayor Bill Trevor gave evidence to the Senate Committee when it visited Queensland\\'s fruit and vegetable growing Bundaberg and Childers region early this year.\\nHe says the inquiry has hardly looked at the many barriers that farmers face in getting workers.\\n\"There is a need within the farming community to be able to access labour and it\\'s very, very difficult at times, especially in peak production periods, for farmers to pick up that extra labour,\" he said.\\nMeat and Livestock Australia (MLA) has launched a national advertising campaign to lift domestic beef sales by $300 million over the next three years.\\nThe $2.8 million promotion will involve television, radio, newspaper and magazine advertisements starting from this Sunday.\\nMLA spokesman David Palmer says it has been seven years since beef has been promoted and it is important to keep consumers thinking about it.\\n\"The ambition over a lengthy period through until 2009/2010 is to to increase the frequency of beef consumption from 2.3 meals to 2.6 meals per week,\" he said.\\n\"There\\'s a TV advertisement which is a bit quirky, a little bit of humour, that takes up back to the beginning of Australia, the beginning of white settlement in Australia.\\n\"You know it\\'s just a good story about beef and summer, and barbeques.\"\\nAnd as part of a new marketing plan for King Island beef, the product is now being used in gourmet meat pies sold at the supermarket.\\nTraditionally, only cuts such as eye fillet and porter house have attracted a premium price for the King Island brand.\\nTasman Group marketing manager Lydia Horsburgh says the pies will open up the product to a wider group of shoppers.\\n\\nYoung cattle prices slip\\nYoung cattle values in eastern Australia have slipped to their lowest level in three years.\\nThe eastern young cattle indicator fell 29.5 cents in the past week to finish yesterday on 267 cents per kilogram carcase weight.\\nThat means the indicator has fallen 28 per cent since January.\\nSouthern Queensland livestock agent Noel Grant says he is not surprised as beef producers run out of feed and water.\\n\"It\\'s something we expected to happen,\" he said.\\n\"The confidence has gone out of the store market generally.\\n\\nDrought relief package changes expected\\nThe Deputy Prime Minister, Mark Vaile, is expected to announce another major drought relief package next week, extending assistance to more farmers, their families and rural businesses.\\nThe package is expected to bring Federal Government drought spending to more than $2 billion.\\nThe Federal Government says further changes to its drought relief package will mean thousands more farmers in more regions will become eligible for exceptional circumstances drought assistance.\\nIt is already encouraging the South and Western Australian state governments to apply for EC status.\\nIt has also listened to calls from Coalition backbenchers for help for farm-related businesses, extra measures to combat rural depression and more emergency assistance for rural families.\\n\\nLocusts threaten Nullarbor crops\\nIt had appeared that crops near the Nullarbor in South Australia\\'s far west look like being some of the best in the nation because they had received reasonable rain.\\nBut now they are under threat from locusts and local farmers say they are not getting the help they need from the State Government.\\nBrian Smith from Coorabie, west of Ceduna, says newly hatched locusts are wreaking havoc on crops.\\n\"For the last week at least we\\'ve been flat out trying to keep them out the crops as they ripen,\" he said.\\n\"A lot of the crops in the district now have sort of ripened, but any crops that are a bit later have taken a fair old hammering.\\n\"One farmer I think is probably going to give up on a 400 or 500 acre paddock of barley.\\n\\nSouth-west NSW residents pray for rain\\nResidents of south-west New South Wales have turned to prayer to break the drought.\\nFarmers and town folk have been united at ecumenical church services.\\nMore than 100 people came together in Wagga to call for rain, while another inter-faith prayer service took place in Leeton.\\nPastor Michael Skewes says aside from the spiritual value of prayer, it was a strong show of support for those on the land.\\n\"I think for the farmers that were here - we saw a number of hands go up and say \\'yeah, we\\'re farmers\\' - for them to know that the Wagga community, we in the city really do care for what they\\'re going through I think that\\'s got enormous value as well,\" he said.\\nIn complete contrast, land clearing fires raging across Kalimantan and Sumatra could be prompting increased rain across the Top End.\\nOver the past 50 years, some station rainfall has increased by up to 300 millimetres.\\nClimatologist Sam Cleland says rainfall in parts of the Victoria River district and Kimberley is increasing by 50 millimetres per decade\\n\"It\\'s potentially that it\\'s not a direct result of greenhouse gases,\" he said.\\n\"It might even be due to increased pollution over South East Asia changing the temperature structure of the atmosphere and the temperature gradient between northern Australia and South East Asia in our summer season.\\n\\nGrain president resigns after single desk comments\\nWrangling over the single desk\\'s future in the nation\\'s largest grain growing state has claimed a scalp.\\nEarlier this week, the Western Australian Farmers Federation\\'s grain president, Ray Marshall, released a new and alternative policy position, urging the single desk be maintained.\\nBut, at least for this season, he urged that the power of veto be removed from AWB and transferred to the Wheat Export Authority.\\nThe statement has divided group members.\\n\\nCalls for Biosecurity Aust to be independent authority \\'out of line\\'\\nA war has broken out over changes to the controversial import risk assessment process.\\nThe federal Agriculture Minister, Peter McGaruan, announced this week that from next year there will be greater scientific scrutiny of the import risk assessments, a regulated time frame and more regular consultation with farmers.\\nWhile the National Farmers Federation says the bulk of its members support the new protocols, chief executive Ben Fargher says calls by NSW farmers for Biosecurity Australia to be made into an independent statutory authority are totally out of line.\\n\"It is always so important to have unity when talking to government,\" he said.\\n\"Disunity when dealing with government is death.\\n\\nGrape growers welcome trade act changes\\nFarmers and small businesses have welcomed the passing of amendments to the Trade Practices Act, which simplify collective bargaining.\\nMurray Valley Winegrowers has been calling for the changes for the past three years.\\nChief executive Mike Stone says growers will now be able to genuinely negotiate with wineries.\\n\"Usually grape buyers give growers a price in say January and unless there\\'s a dispute resolution provision that allows growers to dispute those prices they are taken as a given,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s a take it or leave it proposition often.\\n\\nCSIRO NT plant research division closed\\nThe Northern Territory will no longer host a division of CSIRO\\'s plant industry research.\\nThat is despite increased interest in northern agriculture with its good water supplies, and $1 million from the Territory Government to improve the laboratory.\\n\\nDarwin residents encouraged to save water\\nPeople living across tropical northern Australia are also being urged to conserve water.\\nDarwin residents use more than twice the national average amount of water, but it is hoped converting gardens to suit the dry tropics will help reduce water use.\\nSome politicians, like independent Gerry Wood, are also calling for small dams to be developed in the Daly region, south-west of Darwin.\\n\"I think we have to look at things differently, whether you collect water in off farm dams during the wet season, to pump out in the dry,\" Mr Wood said.\\n\"There is certainly potential on the Daly to increase the amount of food.\\n\\nDrought fails to deter banks from lending\\nDespite the drought, the banks are still keen to lend to farmers.\\nQueensland property valuer Kerry Herron says he believes the property market will come back due to the poor seasonal conditions.\\nHe says the boom in recent years has increased landholders\\' equity and the banks are particularly willing to lend to buyers in the wetter northern regions.\\n\"Cattle is still the flavour of the month and they\\'re still offering very big terms,\" Mr Herron said.\\n\"We have heard instances of up to 30 years interest only payments, certainly 10 and 15 years interest only is common.\\n\\nClimate Institute urges more action on greenhouse emissions\\nThe farmer-funded Climate Institute has launched a national advertising campaign, calling on the Federal Government to do more to reduce Australia\\'s greenhouse gas emissions.\\nThe organisation says the drought has been intensified by climate change and a national carbon trading scheme and increased mandatory renewable energy use targets are needed.\\nIn his weekly online radio message the Prime Minister, John Howard, says the Government is spending $2 billion on reducing climate change.\\nBut the Climate Institute\\'s founder, beef and sheep farmer Mark Wootton, says these measures are not working because greenhouse emissions are increasing.\\n\"Under what is put forward at the moment our greenhouse, the Australian government\\'s current policies, increased emissions by 10 per cent over the last decade and it will increase them by a further 17 per cent by 2020 unless we change what we are doing,\" Mr Wootton said.\\n\\nAnalyst promotes forests as answer to energy supplies\\nAn Australian analyst has dismissed the push for more ethanol and biodiesel production, saying Australia\\'s energy future lies in wood.\\nBarney Foran, a visiting fellow at the Australian National University, says planting 60 million hectares of forests could provide up to 90 per cent of future transport fuels, and 20 per cent of future electricity needs .\\nHe says many different species of wood could be used, including native trees, and this could provide another source of income for farmers in tough times.\\nMr Foran says fuel processing plants should be built in regional areas.\\n\"The key here is that we don\\'t cart wood long distances or else we lose both the economic advantage or more importantly the energy advantage,\" he said.\\n\\nFarm Institute report urges rethink on marketing\\nAn independent farm think tank says the Australian farmer\\'s share of world agriculture exports has fallen by almost $3 billion in a decade.\\nAn Australian Farm Institute report, released today, shows Chile and Brazil\\'s agriculture exports doubled in the 10 years to 2004, while Australia\\'s exports grew by only half that amount.\\nReport author Selwyn Helibron says

control a bushfire north-west of Bathurst.\\nThe fire has burnt 1,400 hectares of grazing and scrub country, threatening a number of houses.\\nThe fire jumped containment lines over the weekend, but was quickly brought back within the lines, by ground crews.\\n\\nSuspension of WTO talks hampers US efforts to fight AWB\\nThe suspension of World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks is making it harder for US farmers and trade officials to take action to try to end AWB\\'s monopoly for exporting Australian wheat.\\nThe last Doha round draft called for banning or phasing out single-desk monopolies, like AWB, by 2013.\\nBut with WTO talks suspended since July, American Farm Bureau trade adviser Dave Salonsen says there is no way for the US to fight AWB.\\n\"If they are operating according to WTO rules, as they exist now and you can\\'t see that they\\'re somehow not following them, there\\'s not much opportunity, potentially, to go through a dispute settlement,\" Mr Salonsen said.\\nAustralia agreed in its bilateral free trade deal with the US to address single desk trading in the WTO round.\\n\\n30,000 cattle imported to Indonesia for Ramadan\\nAt least 30,000 imported cattle have been sold across Indonesia for the Islamic festival of Ramadan.\\nThe last fast will be broken this evening and the food festivities begin with prayer tomorrow morning.\\nGreg Pankhurst from Agrogiri Perkasa, the largest importer of Australian cattle, says he expects 20,000 cattle will be sold in the coming days.\\nBut he says feedlot sales have still been slower this year.\\n\"We haven\\'t been run off our feet in any way,\" Mr Pankhurst said.\\n\"We have gone from our traditional 100 a day to 200 a day, which is normal.\\n\"So I have 100 per cent increase in sale but the next three or four days we won\\'t sell anything because most people have their meat stocks in hand.\\n\"Traditionally after Labaran, which is tomorrow and Wednesday we will see a little bit of an increase over and above our normal sales. So we will probably sell about 120 to 140 a day.\"\\n\\nLivestock prices slump\\nSheep and cattle prices have slumped across the nation, as farmers offload stock they cannot feed.\\nSheep have lost nearly 75 per cent of their value in the past four weeks.\\nYardings in all states have increased substantially, with the southern states hit hardest.\\nTravis Parsci, from the National Livestock Reporting Service, says the falls are drastic.\\n\"In the last fortnight we\\'ve probably seen 20 to 30 cents shaved off a lot of average prices. We have seen a lot of the plainer grades suffering even larger falls,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s been caused by the large number of cattle coming onto the market, as everyone\\'s aware, by the dry condtions, the lack of water in particular and also a lack of feed that a lot of producers are faced with at the moment.\"\\nThe drought is also pushing wool prices up.\\nNews of Australia\\'s plight is prompting wool buyers to stock up for fear that supplies will run out.\\nThe southern market indicator rose by up to 18 cents at last week\\'s national sales, the biggest weekly rise since January.\\nTony Kidman from Quality Wool in south Australia, says buyers also want to avoid buying drought-effected wool, which is less strong than other wool.\\n\\nCampdrafting Council seeking national endorsement\\nCampdrafting officials say they are hopeful a bid to have their sport recognised by the Australian Sports Commission will be successful.\\nThe National Campdraft Council of Australia says while the sport was developed in Australia, it still needs to go through the process to become a national sporting organisation.\\nCouncil president Peter Cookson says that recognition is very important to the sport\\'s funding and future.\\n\"It\\'s giving campdrafting credibility, to have things such as a code of conduct for animal welfare, member protection policy for the protection of our members and their committees and things like that,\" Mr Cookson said.\\n\\nTesting finds Aust wildlife free of bird flu\\nOngoing testing across Australia\\'s most susceptible regions have found no evidence of the new lethal strain of bird flu in wildlife.\\nLast year the H5N1 strain killed thousands of water fowl in China and this year it spread from birds to humans in Indonesia.\\nDr John Curran, from the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, says continuing trapping and testing of wild birds across northern Australia has so far failed to isolate any live influenza viruses.\\n\"But by the same token we\\'re still concerned that the global epidemic is continuing and that this has actually come closer to, the epidemic has come closer to Australia through Indonesia,\" Dr Curran said.\\n\\n$5m study to determine Gippsland groundwater decline\\nThe Federal Government has provided $5 million for a study to find out once and for all what is causing declining groundwater levels in Victoria\\'s south Gippsland.\\nA study by the CSIRO two years ago found subsidence of the Latrobe aquifer was caused mostly by offshore oil and gas production.\\nNow the Department of Sustainability will conduct further research to see if irrigators should be compensated.\\nBill Bodman Senior, from the Victorian Farmers Federation, says the aquifer has been dropping at the rate of one-metre a year for the last 40 years costing farmers thousands of dollars.\\n\"The huge extra cost of lifting the water up the extra distance, that\\'s the major cost in bringing water to the surface,\" Mr Bodman said.\\n\\nCanola crop failure drops yield forecasts\\nThe Australian Oilseeds Federation says canola yield forecasts for 2007 are the lowest for a decade.\\nThe estimate for this year\\'s crop is just 561,000 tonnes, due to the failure of many crops across the nation.\\n\\nGraincorp to ship wheat to eastern states\\nGraincorp is preparing to ship 1 million tonnes of wheat from Western Australia to the eastern states, as harvests fail in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland.\\nThe bulk handler will require approval from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to convert export terminals on the eastern seaboard to import terminals to receive the grain.\\nGraincorp\\'s Sam Tainsh says the grain will be transported by rail as well as sea.\\n\"Graincorp is making a number of inland depots available for large volume rail discharge,\" he said.\\n\\nMurray Irrigation to introduce cost cutting measures\\nThe country\\'s largest private irrigation company, Murray Irrigation, expects to lose several million dollars this financial year because of the drought.\\nThe company will introduce a four day week from mid-November, reduce its weed control programs and defer maintenance in a bid to cut costs.\\nGeneral manager George Warne says directors\\' fees will also be reduced by 20 per cent.\\n\\nNew drought relief package not enough: irrigators\\nIrrigators say new Victorian Government drought relief does not go far enough.\\nThe Victorian Government has announced a $5,000 rebate for farmers who received less than 50 per cent of their water allocation.\\nFarmers still pay water authorities even when they do not receive water, due to the cost of maintaining irrigation channels.\\nChair of the Northern Victorian Irrigators, Dudley Bryant, says with most large dairy and cropping farms paying bills around $30,000, the Government\\'s offer will only make a small difference.\\n\"They have recognised there\\'s a problem there,\" he said.\\n\"They have actually said now that they\\'ll pick up the cost of water even though there may be a lot of small hobby farmers and whatever, and I\\'m not trying to say they should or shouldn\\'t be in it but they are.\\n\\nNSW irrigators fight for water fee relief\\nIrrigators in New South Wales are currently having no joy in receiving assistance for their fixed water charges.\\nOnly one inland valley has received a general security allocation this season and there are demands for fee relief across the state.\\nChairman of Jemalong Irrigation Ted Morgan says the New South Wales Government must develop its own assistance package for irrigators.\\n\"What we\\'re really looking for is where a set of rules is set up for the valleys where, when you have zero allocation some sort of principles kick in like exceptional circumstances,\" he said.\\n\\nAWS announces loss\\nThe wool industry\\'s grower-funded marketing arm has posted a $316,000 annual loss.\\nAustralian Wool Services\\' (AWS) chairman Barry Walker says the company\\'s Woolmark brand and market research divisions both returned profits.\\nBut its processing section, Andar, returned a deficit and the company\\'s substantial debt to a UK pension fund drained $1.3 million from the business.\\nMr Walker says the organisation is battling the effects of the drought and would be deeper in debt if it had not cut costs earlier in the year.\\n\"I think the management did a huge job to reduce the costs against decreased income to actually get us to a loss factor in the finish of $300,000,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re finding that the whole wool chain, from farm right through to retail, is extremely difficult.\\n\\nGovt considers inquiry into forest certification schemes\\nThe Federal Forestry Minister, Eric Abetz, says a push by international green groups to reclassify the sustainable status of Australian timber poses a serious threat to exports.\\nHe says he may set up an inquiry to investigate the disparity between classification systems used to grade old-growth logging in Indonesia, PNG and Australia.\\nSenator Abetz says the Government is determined to resist a push by the Mexico-based Forest Stewardship Council for Australian timber to lose its \\'A\\' rating among some European customers.\\n\"These groups are then bad mouthing Australia\\'s forest products in countries like the United Kingdom and Belgium,\" he said.\\n\\nGrowers back forest biofuels industry development\\nA national group representing commercial and private forest growers has thrown its support behind the development of a forest biofuels industry.\\nAustralian Forest Growers is holding its international conference in Launceston this week and the association\\'s president, David Geddes, says such an industry could be an opportunity for drought-affected farmers.\\nHe says trees are less susceptible to drought than other crops and the wood thinnings would be a valuable source of biofuel.\\n\\nUS beef exports to Korea delayed\\nA technical issue is delaying the resumption of US beef exports to Korea.\\nUS packers had hoped for an agreement with South Korea on a \"bone chip\" definition this month after the Koreans agreed in early September to resume imports of US boneless beef.\\nUS Agriculture Department deputy under-secretary, Chuck Lambert, wrote to the Koreans over a month ago and has not had a response.\\n\"The producer segment in Korea\\'s been very opposed to reopening the market, so there is a lot of political pressure in opposition to reopening the market, but the agreement has been that we would open for boneless beef,\" he said.\\nBut the Koreans have said they will have zero tolerance for bone chips.\\n\\nIndustry, Govt urged to take mining exploration seriously\\nThe mining industry says Australia is sending billions of dollars overseas because of a lack of incentives for local exploration.\\nAustralian companies are at the forefront of an exploration boom in regions like Africa and South America, which offer attractive tax and cost incentives.\\nWhile mineral exploration worldwide has hit a record high of more than $US5 billion annually, Australia\\'s share has halved in 10 years.\\nJustin Walawski from the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies says it is time for industry and the Government to take the issue seriously.\\n\\nCaptive breeding set to boost tuna stocks\\nA South Australian company says it could duplicate Australia\\'s entire wild catch of more than 5,000 tonnes of tuna within a decade through captive breeding.\\nThis follows the successful airlift of nine southern bluefin tuna from offshore sea cages into a $6 million tank built by Clean Seas Tuna at Arno Bay.\\nThe fish will be used to spawn millions of eggs for harvesting in the world\\'s first captive breeding program for the species.\\nChairman Hagen Stehr says he could not put a price on the brood stock.\\n\\nHobby farmers work on solving sheep shearing problem\\nIt is hard to find a shearer if you are a hobby farmer and perhaps have just half a dozen pet sheep.\\nBut the growing number of hobby farmers in Western Australia\\'s south-west are working on the problem.\\nThe local community of Manjimup had its sheep shorn, drenched and de-loused for a small fee, with all proceeds to be donated back into the community.\\nLocal shearer Ron Nivon says it is the best way to handle the region\\'s increasing number of pet sheep.\\n\"This is the best thing that ever happened. I think we\\'ve been doing it for over 20 years. It\\'s a great cause,\" he said.\\n\"You don\\'t have that phone ringing and nuisance phone calls asking for five or six sheep shorn when you should be out doing three or 4,000 sheep.\\n\\nCBH set to launch wheat export pool\\nAustralia\\'s troubled wheat exporter AWB has another force to deal with today with Western Australia\\'s largest grain bulk handler, CBH, attempting to launch a wheat export pool of its own this harvest.\\nAs Western Australian growers consider how they will sell their wheat crop this season, the company today has launched an export licence to test the power of veto that AWB has over its single desk licence.\\nA previous attempt and subsequent appeal by CBH last December were lost.\\nCBH chief executive Imre Mencshelyi says the new move will not undermine the single desk and will put more money into growers pockets this season.\\n\"We\\'ve agonised over that decision for sometime and today we\\'re launching the CBH wheat pool for 2 million tonne volume for West Australian grain growers,\" he said.\\n\"At the end of the day we recognise there\\'ll be divided opinion on what we\\'ll be putting out in the market place but the growers will have this opportunity to deliver and they\\'ll vote by their actions.\"\\nAWB\\'s Ian Donges says that the export application is an attack on the single desk, and will not necessarily result in growers being paid a higher price over the life of the proposed CBH pool.\\nMeanwhile, AWB has increased its new season pool returns for premium wheat to $245 a tonne, up $5.\\n\\nGold mine operator agrees to provide water to farmers\\nFarmers have had a breakthrough in their dispute with the new Lake Cowal gold mine in the central west of New South Wales, which has had a dramatic impact on local bore water levels.\\nThe water level has dropped from 20 metres to 50 metres below ground level.\\nLachlan Valley Water\\'s Mary Ewing says the company has now agreed to provide stock and domestic water to farmers, if the water table continues to drop.\\n\"One of the requirements is that if those trigger levels are approached, you have to continue to supply the impacted stock and domestics,\" she said.\\n\"So while there is water there I guess stock and domestic will be maintained.\\n\\nAnger over latest drought assistance\\nFarm-related businesses are angry they have been left out of the Federal Government\\'s extended drought assistance package.\\nAn extra $560 million has been allocated to extend assistance to 10,000 more farmers in five states, on top of last week\\'s $350 million announcement.\\nThe president of the Australian Contract Harvesters Association, Peter Bradley, says agriculture-reliant businesses, like harvesters, are also struggling to survive the summer.\\n\"We\\'ve been asking and asking and asking the Federal Government for some assistance, but it\\'s got to the stage where it\\'s totally and absolutely critical at this stage that we do at least get interest rate subsidies on our financing.\"\\nBut the drought package has been welcomed by the National Farmers Federation and the Association of Rural Financial Counselling Services.\\nAnd the Country Womens Association president, Lesley Young, says the $4 million her organisation has received will allow it to revive emergency aid programs.\\n\\nLower canola yield a boosts returns\\nThe huge drop in canola production has sent prices up as high as $555 a tonne at east coast ports, almost double last year\\'s returns.\\nCanola yield forecasts for 2007 are the lowest for a decade due to the drought, down to just 561,000 tonnes, a third of the size of last year\\'s crop.\\nAustralian Wheat Forecasters analyst Ron Storey says canola will have to be transported from coast to coast to meet crushing requirements.\\n\"Most of the canola crop this year will be in Western Australia, we look like having you know something under half a million tonnes of canola in total and more than half of that is going to be in WA,\" he said.\\n\\nFarmers to import alternative dairy cattle feed\\nDairy farmers will continue to use alternative feeds such as palm kernel meal as grain supplies tighten.\\nFarmers in Victoria say grain prices have jumped from $215 to $360 per tonne in recent weeks.\\nBrian Bailey, from grain price monitoring company AWF, says dairy farmers will have to import more of the alternative feeds.\\n\"You can get the requirements of energy protein and amino acids from products such as palm kernel meal which comes from Malaysia,\" he said.\\n\\nGrain price rise hits chicken producers\\nIncreased grain prices are also affecting chicken meat producers and processors.\\nPhilip Schmidt from the South Australian Farmers Federation says grain makes up the largest expense for producers, who will struggle to cut costs elsewhere.\\n\"The cost of grains is rising quite significantly over the last year to approximately nationally about 80 per cent already increase,\" he said.\\n\\nWine glut prompts call for structural change\\nA new report on Australia\\'s wine industry says our stocks have ballooned to an estimated two billion litres, as global wine production grows faster then demand.\\nThe study by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics also warns Australia has no ability to influence the world wine market, because it has only 5 per cent of global production.\\nChris Byrne, from the Riverland Wine Grape Growers Association, says serious structural change is needed.\\n\"We\\'re producing more than double the amount of wine grapes we need from those regions that cannot afford to grow popular premium products,\" he said.\\n\"You have to solve that by working with growers and wine-makers to decide which regions cannot be sustainable.\\n\\nMixed response to CBH\\'s wheat export push\\nThere has been mixed reaction in Western Australia to the state\\'s main grain handler CBH launching a bid to export two million tonnes of wheat this harvest.\\nCBH announced it would offer grain growers $265-275 a tonne, topping the offer of monopoly exporter AWB.\\nThe Western Australian Farmers Federation says the plan encourages short-term thinking and it is worried about the impact of taking so much grain from the national pool.\\nBut Leon Bradley, from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association, says growers should have another wheat export option.\\n\"Well the main benefit is too obvious to state,\" he said.\\n\"$20 or $30 above AWB\\'s estimate, which is very significant in a low production year in terms of farm profitability.\"\\nMeanwhile, the federal Treasurer, Peter Costello, has further opened divisions in the Coalition over the future of the single desk wheat export system.\\nDeputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile says the Government remains committed to the single desk until the Cole inquiry into AWB kickback allegations reports.\\nBut Mr Costello has suggested wheat growers should get the chance to export wheat at the higher rates being offered by CBH.\\n\\nDairy farmers co-op announces profit increase\\nThe Sydney-based Dairy Farmers Co-operative has announced a 25 per cent increase in its profits for the last financial year.\\nThe co-operative has posed a $17.4 million profit at a meeting in Sydney today.\\n\\nGroup to consider moratorium over land clearing\\nAn important meeting of land managers is taking place today in the Northern Territory\\'s Douglas Daly region, south-west of Darwin.\\nAllocation of water and land clearing head the agenda of the Government-appointed advisory group, which is preparing to make recommendations.\\nPastoralists, like Diana Elliot of Kingfisher Station, want the moratorium over land clearing lifted quickly.\\nShe says broken promises about development have prompted some investors to consider seeking compensation.\\n\"At the moment we have cleared one-seventh of our block, and we would be looking to clear at least say 30 per cent,\" she said.\\n\\nSeaweed fertiliser helping farmers battle frost\\nFarmers are using seaweed fertiliser as a way to protect horticultural crops from frost.\\nVictoria has had several frosts in the past month, with cherries, grapes, stone fruit and apple crops being damaged.\\nScientists believe the liquid fertiliser works by hardening the plants cells, so the frost cannot pull the moisture out of the fruit.\\nConsultant Dr Colin Young, a former Melbourne University chemistry professor, says there are limitations to the seaweed\\'s effect.\\n\"It takes 12 hours to kick in and then gives you reasonable protection for two weeks then it starts to decrease,\" he said.\\n\\nTas couple take out top tree farming award\\nTasmanians John and Diana Lord have been declared Australia\\'s top tree farmers.\\nThe Lords, from Longford in the state\\'s north, won the title from among six other state finalists at the Australian Forest Growers international conference in Launceston last night.\\nThe family started tree farming in the 1980s and now manages three forest properties and a 1,200-hectare mixed farm.\\nJohn Lord says his philosophy has been to plant trees on abandoned farmland where native bush cannot be re-established.\\n\"Over the past couple of decades we\\'ve bought some land that was derelict, mainly on the Western Tiers,\" he said.\\n\\nCherries make $55,000 for charity\\nA record $55,000 has been paid for two boxes of the season\\'s first cherries at a charity auction in Sydney.\\nThey were bought by the owner of a chain of fruit shops in Sydney and will be distributed to children in hospital.\\nCherry Growers president Ian Hay says there was fierce competition to supply the charity box between growers from Griffith in New South Wales and the South Australian Riverland.\\n\"They actually had a competition in the central markets to get the best box of cherries and they couldn\\'t split between these two cases so they actually put up two cases,\" he said.\\n\\nDaylight saving bill introduced to WA Parliament\\nAfter years of resistance, Western Australians could have daylight saving in place by this summer.\\nA bill will be introduced into State Parliament today to set-up a daylight saving trial from the start of December.\\nIf the bill is passed, a referendum will take place after three summers, in 2009.\\n\\nPM to hear farmers\\' drought concerns\\nFarmers will put their concerns about the Federal Government\\'s drought assistance package to the Prime Minister today.\\nJohn Howard has started a two day tour of drought hit regions in New South Wales, as dryland farmers call for grants to re-sow their crops when the drought breaks.\\nMr Howard says now that the Federal Government has committed a total of $2.1 billion in drought assistance, it is time for the states to do their part in the form of water rates relief.\\nMr Howard is particularly critical of the NSW Government because he says some of the Federal Government\\'s drought assistance is going straight into their coffers for water charges.\\n\\nDrought stricken areas to receive extra funding\\nThe South Australian Government will provide a further $4 million to help drought stricken farming families and communities.\\nSome of the new measures include $1.3 million for stamp-duty relief, $330,000 for more rural financial counselling services and funds to help the SA Farmers Federation (SAFF) coordinate exceptional circumstances applications.\\nState Agriculture Minister Rory McEwen says much of South Australia still has to mount a case for drought assistance.\\n\"We are providing resources to both SAFF to coordinate the applications and to community or industry group that\\'s done the application, the resources they need to actually put the application together,\" he said.\\n\"The challenge in South Australia of course is a whole lot of us aren\\'t EC declared.\\n\\nRain prospects improve\\nThere is an improved prospect of rain for some parts of Australia over summer.\\nThe National Climate Centre\\'s latest climate outlook still predicts some of the country\\'s most drought affected land will stay drier than normal over the next three months.\\nSouth-east Queensland and much of New South Wales will only have a 30 to 40 per cent chance of receiving above average rainfall.\\nAnd a hot summer is still forecast for most of eastern Australia, with the confirmation of the El Nino weather pattern.\\nBut meteorologist Grant Beard says it is not all bad news, as some areas could get above average rainfall.\\n\"It\\'s more encouraging for northern and north-west Queensland,\" he said.\\n\"There\\'s an increased likelihood of wetter than average conditions there and it\\'s not quite as discouraging as it was in the south-east of the country as well where the probabilities have risen from around about 40 per cent or a bit lower last outlook.\\n\\nGovt grant to help cut dairy processor\\'s water use\\nThe major dairy processor in Victoria, Murray Goulburn, is receiving assistance from the Bracks Government to help it cut back on its water use.\\nThe Murray Goulburn plant in Leongatha in Gippsland is one of the biggest water consumers in the region.\\nChairman of Murray Goulburn Ian McAulay says he hopes the $1.6 million government grant will mean there is more water left for local towns and farms.\\n\"This one is quite significant,\" he said.\\n\\nProject to boost truckie numbers\\nThe transport industry is holding out its arms to farmers needing employment during the drought.\\nA short course in truck driving is being offered at Wodonga in Victoria by the National Industrial Skills Training Centre to allow farmers to re-train as truckies.\\nManager Sput Lowry says the project will help boost driver numbers.\\n\\nGovt urged to acquire Snowy Hydro\\nA New South Wales parliamentary inquiry has called on the Federal Government to acquire Snowy Hydro, but to guarantee the electricity generator remain in public hands.\\nInquiry chairman the Reverend Gordon Moyes says Snowy Hydro needs a capital injection of $800 million to remain viable in the national electricity market, but that share holding governments are reluctant to fund it.\\n\\nBananas not to blame for inflation rise: wholesaler\\nThe Queensland fruit and vegetable industry says it is ridiculous to blame inflation on the price of bananas.\\nThe latest consumer price figure rose 0.9 per cent in the three months to September, with the federal Treasurer singling out banana prices as a factor.\\nAnd on the basis of the CPI, the Reserve Bank is expected to increase interest rates next month.\\nBut Brisbane wholesaler Tony Joseph says while banana prices have gone through the roof, there has only been 10 per cent of normal supplies on the market .\\n\"Bananas have been as high as 130, $140 a case, which is way above their normal price, most probably around the mid-20s when we\\'ve got a full supply of bananas,\" he said.\\n\\nCloned animal products may reach US shelves\\nConsumers in the US may see meat and dairy products from cloned animals on their supermarket shelves next year.\\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has submitted draft recommendations to Washington, which appear to support the sale of products from cloned animals, quoting research that says the food will be as safe as that from conventionally-bred animals.\\nThe sale of cloned animal product is currently prohibited in the US.\\nBut Scott Kinnear, from the Biological Farmers of Australia, says organic farmers are watching the issue with concern.\\n\"We don\\'t think that cloned foods are necessarily safe for the long-term,\" he said.\\n\\nNSW cherry growers to push for southern market\\nNew South Wales cherry growers will renew a push today to get their fruit into southern Australian markets by raising the issue when the Prime Minister visits Goulburn.\\nThe producers have been stopped from getting fruit into these markets because of concerns over fruit flies.\\nNational Cherry Growers president, Ian Hay, says despite international markets accepting fruit fly management protocols, southern states will not accept them.\\n\"If we can do protocols to get fruit safely overseas, surely we have got to be able to move it across the country as well,\" he said.\\n\"If we don\\'t make sure we have tidied up that homework here in Australia, those countries to protect their borders and decide they won\\'t need a tariff, they will just turn around and say, \\'hey you can\\'t even get cherries out of NSW into Victoria.\\'\\n\\nMine to reopen due to surging gold prices\\nThe Bronzewing gold mine in central Western Australia is set to reopen on the back of climbing gold prices.\\nThe mine and its extraction plant and accommodation village have been mothballed for the past three years after being bought for $9 million by View Resources.\\nManaging director Tim Gooch says the company has secured debt financing and says strong investor support and current market conditions could see the open cut and underground mine operating again within months.\\n\"We\\'ve been modelling on around $A800 an ounce,\" he said.\\n\\nVets to audit captive devils after tumour discovery\\nVets in Tasmania are conducting an audit of a wildlife parks in the north of the State after the discovery this week of two devils with the devastating facial tumour disease.\\nIt is the first time the disease has been found within a captive population.\\nIt has already wiped out half the wild devil population.\\nVeterinary pathologist Stephen Pyecroft says as yet there is no screening test available for the disease, so it is a waiting game for the rest of the devils at the wildlife park.\\n\"One of the areas that we have been looking at reasonably closely since the start of the program is to try to get an indicator test or the thing that we are sort of calling a clinical test for the cancer,\" he said.\\n\\nNorthern pastoralists not convinced about daylight saving\\nThe debate about introducing a three-year trial for daylight saving in Western Australia has left pastoralists in the tropics feeling excluded.\\nThe daylight saving Bill was introduced to Parliament this week and is expected to receive support from most MPs.\\nIf it passes, clocks will be put forward an hour in December.\\nBut one pastoralist in the Kimberley, where it is already 39 degrees Celsius each day, says it will not advantage him.\\n\"We normally start very early,\" he said.\\n\\nTrading hours row closes Palace Hotel\\nOne of the country\\'s most famous outback hotels has called last drinks for the last time after failing to win a bid to trade for 24 hours.\\nThe Palace Hotel in Broken Hill opened in the 1880s and achieved worldwide fame by appearing in the film Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\\nBut last night, owner Marat Celotto shut the doors, saying his business was doomed following the council\\'s refusal to extend his trading hours.\\n\"It\\'s a very hard decision at the moment,\" he said.\\n\\nRural incomes predicted to slump\\nA major bank is forecasting rural incomes will fall by 60 per cent this financial year.\\nThe National Australia Bank predicts incomes will drop by $4.6 billion from last year to just $3 billion.\\nBut the bank\\'s Jeff Oughton does not believe it will push farmers off the land.\\n\"I don\\'t think a lot of farmers will be leaving the industry, going into this drought we\\'ve seen farm property values rise very strongly over the past five years,\" he said.\\n\\nABARE farm production estimates lowered again\\nThere is another gloomy forecast from the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) today.\\nIt has further lowered its estimate for this year\\'s drought-hit wheat harvest to 9.5 million tonnes, the smallest crop since 1995.\\nIt says the national barley crop could drop 64 per cent on last year, with canola yields down 69 per cent.\\nABARE also says beef earnings are expected to fall 13 per cent.\\n\\nPM\\'s drought tour focuses on irrigation\\nThe Prime Minister is continuing his tour of drought-affected areas of New South Wales and today the focus is on the irrigation industry.\\nTonight at Finley, in the Riverina, the locals will gather to pray for rain.\\nBut today, they are asking the John Howard for help.\\nOn a visit to a dairy farm, Mr Howard heard that with zero water allocation, producers have been forced to pay high prices for temporary water.\\nThat, coupled with rising costs of feed grain, is putting the squeeze on farm finances.\\nMr Howard is also expected to meet with local community leaders later this afternoon.\\nMeanwhile, young farmers, harvesters and other farm contractors say the drought assistance package probably will not be enough to keep many of them on the land.\\nWestern NSW crop spraying contractor, Andrew Oliver, who spoke to Mr Howard yesterday, says he and his friends are sick of watching their businesses run down.\\n\\nFrost devastates Clare Valley vineyards\\nAnother of South Australia\\'s premium wine regions has been devastated by frost.\\nThe Barossa Valley, Coonawarra and Padthway have experienced crop losses ranging from 20 and 90 per cent.\\nNow the Clare Valley, north of Adelaide, has also been hit.\\nTrelawney Vineyard manager Tracey Sandow estimates last weekend\\'s big freeze ruined hundreds of tonnes of grapes.\\n\"The frost came in Saturday morning and anything on the low lying areas of the vineyard was basically blackened off completely,\" she said.\\n\\nStorms bring good and bad to mid-west farmers\\nIt has been a mix of pain and good fortune for Western Australia\\'s farmers and pastoralists, after wild storms tore through the Gascoyne, Murchison and parts of the mid-west and northern wheatbelt.\\nStrong winds and rainfall of 60 to 90 millimetres destroyed some farm crops and damaged fences.\\nBut further north, pastoralists have welcomed the rain after such a dry winter.\\nGeoff Pilkington from Kirkalocka Station, south of Mt Magnet, says strong winds and hail created a fierce storm.\\n\"Dark skies and threatening for most of the morning and then the heavens just opened and it was just amazing,\" he said.\\n\"At the mine site and in Mt Magnet town site, there was huge hail stones and apparently they were the size of golf balls and two or three inches thick on the ground, so it\\'s just an amazing event.\"\\n\\nTobacco growers vote to accept exit package\\nAustralia no longer has a legal tobacco growing industry.\\nTobacco was grown in Queensland and Victoria, but British American Tobacco and Phillip Morris have now announced they will be withdrawing from Australia by 2008 because overseas crops are cheaper.\\nGrowers in both states yesterday voted to accept an exit package made up of $15 million from the tobacco companies and $17 million from the Federal Government.\\nThat amounts to a maximum payment of $150,000 per grower, which producers say is an offer too good to refuse.\\nQueensland Nationals Senator Ron Boswell says the Government hopes the tobacco farmers will be able to find alternative crops, but admits it will be difficult.\\n\"In the case of Merribra it\\'s a long way from the market so it\\'s difficult to find something they can grow commercially, but some of the farms may go over to sugar which is doing okay at the moment,\" he said.\\n\\nGM cotton gets green light in northern Australia\\nThe Office of the Gene Technology Regulator has approved the commercial release of genetically modified (GM) cotton for northern Australia.\\nIt is satisfied that five varieties of GM cotton designed to be herbicide and insect resistant will have minimum impacts on tropical environments.\\nThe decision is unlikely to benefit Western Australia\\'s Kimberley region, since the State Government has a moratorium on all GM crops until 2008.\\nBut Cotton Australia\\'s Philip Russell says there is now nothing stopping farmers in north Queensland growing it commercially when prices pick up.\\n\"In Queensland there\\'s no moratorium and we certainly have some interested people up in the Burdekin area of north Queensland who potentially could grow cotton,\" he said.\\n\\nBega Cheese chalks up $10.5m profit\\nIt is a record profit year, despite the drought, for New South Wales based dairy business Bega Cheese.\\nIt posted a $10.5 million profit on a $280 million turnover.\\nThe Bega Dairy Co-op employs more than 500 people, exports to 50 countries and produces Australia\\'s top-selling domestic cheese brand.\\nChairman Barry Irvin says all the Co-op profits were returned to the 100 farmer owners, to help see them through the worst drought in a century.\\n\\nNickel mining reveals promising results\\nUnderground miners at Australia\\'s newest nickel mine have intersected the first of a number of a high grade nickel sulphide ore bodies.\\nThe Flying Fox mine at Forestania, 400 kilometres east of Perth, hosts one of the highest grade nickel deposits in the world.\\nThe price of nickel is currently at a record high.\\nWestern Areas NL managing director Julian Hanna says it is just the beginning of a long-term nickel operation.\\n\"Initially that ore will be toll treated at a nearby treatment plant to produce a nickel concentrate which will end up being exported to Canada,\" he said.\\n\\nWaste water scheme to benefit Tamworth farm\\nTamworth council in north-west New South Wales has showcased one of the first environmental spin-offs of a planned waste water project.\\nIt is a 140 hectare wedge of rehabilitated grassy box woodlands at the edge of what will become a farm which re-uses the city\\'s water and effluent to grow crops.\\nTamworth regional water augmentation manager Nigel Thompson says the project has environmental bonuses for the city.\\n\\nWage increase causes concern\\nAgricultural employers are voicing their concern about the Australian Fair Pay Commission\\'s wage increase to low-paid workers.\\nThe commission yesterday granted workers on less than $700 a week an extra $27.36 in their pay packet.\\nThe National Farmers Federation says it is disappointed with the decision.\\nAnd Michael Badcock, from grower group AUSVEG, says the increase will make it harder for Australia to compete with imported fruit and vegetables.\\n\"It\\'s going to put vegetable farmers in Australia in a very bad position,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve got a lot of pressures with cheaper imports coming into Australia and now all of a sudden we\\'ve got to pay this extra increase in wages.\\n\"It\\'s going to make it very difficult for us to compete in the global market.\"\\nThe Australian Workers Union, which represents many low-paid employees in agriculture, says the increase is good but could have been better.\\nOrganiser Terry O\\'Connor admits he was pleasantly surprised by the decision.\\n\\nMinister to sport new \\'cat in the hat\\' headgear\\nFederal Environment Minister Ian Campbell is getting an unusual present in the mail from King Island in northern Tasmania.\\nIt is a hat made from a feral cat pelt collected during the island\\'s cat trapping program.\\nSenator Campbell was on King Island recently and mentioned he would not mind a hat as a reminder of his trip.\\nHat maker Robyn Eades says she hopes the size is right for a politician\\'s head.\\n\\nTassie cow gets leg up\\nThe famous three-legged Tasmanian cow called Theresa is back on all fours after being fitted with a prosthetic leg this week.\\nTheresa broke a back leg in July when she fell down a river bank and her owner had the leg amputated.\\nAfter considerable media coverage, offers of wooden legs came from across Australia and an artificial limb maker from Launceston delivered on the challenge.\\nTheresa\\'s owner, Geoff Heazlewood, says he never expected to see his heifer with a wooden leg.\\n\"No I didn\\'t, it was sort of one of those silly ideas that became reality I guess,\" he said.\\n\\nFishing industry wants govt help to keep businesses afloat\\nThe fishing industry is trying to adapt to the recent Federal Government buyback of 400 fishing licences.\\nThe buyback has led to a 70 per cent drop in fish being supplied to the Twofold fishing co-operative at Eden on the south coast of New South Wales.\\nBut chairman Fritz Drenkhahn says members are chasing federal assistance to keep the business afloat.\\n\"The decision of the members was yes to go ahead to strive in all directions to maintain it open [but] a lot hinges on the business assistance package which we\\'ll be applying for,\" he said.\\n\\nPig ad campaign misleading, say pork producers group\\nAnimal rights activists have launched a new advertising campaign against pig farming.\\nThe ads, put together by the groups Voiceless and Animals Australia, depict pigs in small pens with minimal room and piglets having their eye teeth clipped.\\nBut Australian Pork Limited says the campaign is misleading.\\nSpokesman Andrew Spencer says the ads are designed to be emotional and are not an accurate reflection of how pigs are grown commercially in Australia.\\n\"The types of words they\\'re using are not trying to portray the independent view of the way pigs are raised,\" he said.\\n\\nWool prices spike\\nThe wool market has hit a two year high.\\nThe eastern market indicator rose a further 3 per cent last week to close on 782 cents a kilogram.\\nThe biggest price hikes were for wool in the medium 19 to 24 micron range, up between 30 and 59 cents a kilogram in Sydney.\\nChairman of Inland New South Wales Wool Brokers Rowan Woods says buyers are becoming worried about future supply.\\n\"This had to come. I think there is a real perception or a realisation from the trade that supply will be tight,\" he said.\\n\"The number of stock that are being sold. You have only got to look at Wagga - 250,000 sheep roughly in a month down there. A hell of a big dent in the number of sheep that will supply wool to the trade.\\n\\nWork visa crackdown won\\'t stop exploitation, says union\\nThe Meat Industry Union says a new crack down on temporary work visas will not stop migrant exploitation.\\nThe Federal Government will set up an investigative strike force to make sure employers are complying with the conditions of the 457 visas, which allow skilled overseas workers into Australia.\\nUnion spokesman Russell Carr says problems are mainly in smaller meat processing workers, which are largely un-unionised.\\n\"What would be better is what would have applied before the industrial law changes to allow unions right of access to those workplaces and unions will check that out for free of charge for the taxpayer,\" he said.\\n\\nBeef producers urged not to vote in MLA elections\\nThe Australian Beef Association (ABA) says beef producers should not bother voting in this year\\'s board elections for peak body Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA).\\nThe renegade lobby group has failed to win previous resolutions to remove directors from the MLA board and has not submitted any this year.\\nPresident Linda Hewitt says it is pointless to vote because ABA resolutions can be vetoed by the MLA board.\\nBut MLA managing director David Palmer says that has never occurred.\\n\"All I can say is that we should just look at history. Several resolutions have come up year after year,\" he said.\\n\"Some from the board, some from the registered levy payers, all have been voted upon and all have been acted upon and no vetoes have been applied from board\\'s or from council of that matter.\"\\n\\nLivestock transporters fear for future\\nSome livestock transporters fear they will be forced to leave the industry because of the drought.\\nTransporters, who face hundreds of thousands of dollars in operational costs, were not included in the Federal Government\\'s recent $700 million drought package.\\nPresident of the Livestock Transporter\\'s Association Mark Sullivan says while operators have been kept busy carting thousands of drought affected sheep and cattle, that will soon slow down as stock numbers dwindle.\\n\"I was speaking to a couple of Victorian members, they reckon their workload is fairly hectic, but what they\\'re worried about is when it comes [during] January and February, when the impact of it happens, what they\\'re going to do next,\" he said.\\n\\nACT officially in drought\\nThe ACT has been drought-declared, giving 90 farmers access to federal and local government assistance.\\nAs part of the package, rates will not have to be paid and rural lease payments will be deferred.\\nThe ACT Government also plans to give farmers transport subsidies, in line with New South Wales.\\nGrazier Tony Griffin says he would normally be able to cut enough silage for next winter, but not this year.\\n\"I\\'ve got five semi-loads of hay starting today actually,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re getting it from western NSW, it\\'s really failed wheat crops.\"\\nMeanwhile Australia\\'s drought and its human toll are getting a lot of attention in the United States.\\nUS agriculture officials are watching the Australian drought disaster closely and not just its impact on US wheat prospects, but its toll on lives.\\nFrom a USDA reporter: \"A farmer suicide every four days ... that\\'s what\\'s happening in Australia right now, according to a mental health group there.\"\\nAnd USDA meteorologist Harlan Shannon says a developing El Nino could mean more hot, dry weather for Australian grain and livestock.\\n\"It\\'s not going to be good for Australian farmers, at least, historically speaking, it hasn\\'t been, And so, if it does continue to intensify, the road ahead doesn\\'t look too good,\" he said.\\n\\nCyclone recovery work boosts local economy: economist\\nThere are claims today that north Queensland\\'s economy will end up $400 million better off because of cyclones Larry and Monica.\\nCyclone damage has been estimated at around $500 million while insurance payouts and government assistance are said to total up to 900 million.\\nCairns economist Bill Cummings says the recovery work has also boosted the economy.\\n\\nVine heating may eliminate frost damage\\nAn Australian physicist says frost damage in vineyards could be eliminated if vines themselves were heated.\\nMost frost prevention measures concentrate on heating the air around the vines to stop frost forming.\\nThe University of New England is researching whether electric cables can be trailed around vines to heat them by one or two degrees, to prevent grape buds from freezing.\\nAssociate Professor Dr David Lamb says the system first appeared in France, but has never been tried in Australia.\\n\\nLand rights anniversary commemorated\\nThe anniversary of land rights in South Australia has been commemorated in the state\\'s far north-west.\\nThe Pitjantjatjara people were given freehold title to 103 square kilometres under an agreement with the State Government in 1981.\\nIt was the first deal of its type in Australia.\\nState Aboriginal Affairs Minister Jay Weatherill say the anniversary comes at a time when governments need to rethink their approach to Aboriginal communities.\\n\"This is the first place in Australia that gave freehold title to a community so it\\'s a very important occasion,\" he said.\\n\\nImported feed grain expected to ease shortages\\nThe Federal Government expects the first imports of feed grain for livestock to arrive in Australia in January to ease looming shortages.\\nMore than 40 import applications are being assessed from companies wanting to fill shortfalls caused by the drought.\\nBiosecurity Australia officers are making the first assessments of wheat, maize and sorghum in the UK, Canada and the UK.\\nBut Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the imports are not likely to make a major difference in prices.\\n\"It\\'s a question of balance that we have a million cattle in feedlots at present and of course the dairy, pig meat and chicken industries are terribly dependent on grain,\" he said.\\n\"So for those who are able to produce grain we don\\'t want to suppress their price and in any event I don\\'t think the amounts being able to be imported will amount to a flood.\"\\nMeanwhile the drought has forced South Australian grain marketing company ABB to accept poorer quality grain.\\nThe company has reduced its screenings for malt barley and will accept smaller and less plump grain.\\nABB\\'s Lyndon Asser says the move will benefit growers as the company tries to secure more supply.\\n\\nOrganised crime targeted by fishing Bill\\nOrganised crime in the fishing industry will be targeted by tough new penalties if the State Government\\'s Fisheries Management Bill becomes law. A recent study by the Australian Institute of Criminology has revealed organised criminal activity in the industry with syndicates operating across state boundaries. South Australia\\'s director of Fisheries Will Zacharin says this is one of the reasons why tougher penalties for illegal fishing have been included in the Bill which was introduced to Parliament last week. Mr Zacharin says it also includes a demerit points system for commercial licence holders.\\n\\nLocusts took department \"by surprise\"\\nThe director of agriculture Don Plowman says there is little his department could have done to stop the damage caused by locusts to crops grown in the Coorabie district of the far west. And he says the explosion of locust hatchings took both Primary Industries SA and local growers by by surprise. Mr Plowman was responding to criticism by grain growers in the Coorabie district who say they didn\\'t get practical help from the department to stop the pests damaging their crops. He says the department will monitor the situation over summer and autumn.Strong gains for wool\\nThe best price rises for wool in two years were achieved at last week\\'s national wool sales, Elders wool manager Mark Rodda reported. He says this reflects concern by overseas buyers that Australia\\'s drought will reduce supply and they will not be able to secure the wool they need. Mr Rodda says the best increases were in the medium to broad wools. Nineteen micron wools jumped 27cents/kilogram to finish at 953c/kg clean; 21m were up 51c to 815c/kg; 22m increased by 57c to 787c and the 23m rose 49c to 756c.\\n\\nFarmers to bear higher feed costs\\nThe drought is expected to push up food prices with fewer crops and more expensive water.\\nBut consumers will not be the only ones bearing the increased costs.\\nMarket vegetable prices to consumers are expected to rise by at least 30 per cent but many growers are locked into fixed contracts with processors.\\nIn some states dairy farmers have contracted prices or are paid based on world prices and so will have to bear some of the the higher costs of cattle feed themselves.\\nChicken meat is expected to rise by about 15 per cent, but although red meat prices will rise in the long term, initially price fluctuations are expected to be absorbed by retailers.\\nBreakfast cereals will rise.\\n\\nGovt urged to take control over vegetable imports\\nUnions in Tasmania are calling for the Federal Government to take greater control over vegetable imports to save Australia\\'s processing industry.\\nAbout 10 jobs are expected to be lost at a McCain Foods\\' plant in north-west Tasmania because of a loss of sales.\\nAnne Urquart from the Manufacturing Workers Union says imports, a rise in home brands and a lack of country-of-origin labelling is putting processors under pressure.\\n\"I\\'m really concerned since it\\'s only 12 months since the farmers had a very large rally that identified the concern about not only the labelling but the actual importing of frozen vegetables,\" she said.\\n\\nUS company tests South Korean import protocols\\nA shipment of US beef has arrived in South Korea for the first time in nearly three years but exporters appear nervous about the future of the market.\\nThe US Agriculture Department says the consignment is from a company testing new import protocols designed to minimise the risk of mad cow disease.\\nBut other companies are waiting to see how it is received in a market now dominated by Australia.\\nUS Department of Agriculture Deputy Undersecretary Chuck Lambert says despite Korea\\'s market reopening to US boneless beef on September 11 after a 2003 mad cow case, the US industry remains reluctant to ship, even though one US firm shipped nine tonnes this week.\\n\"The reluctance to ship has been by the US industry, related to concerns about how Korea might handle findings of small pieces of bone, or bone chips. We have had one company who has elected to test the system,\" he said.\\nMr Lambert is still waiting on Seoul for a response to his letter, asking the Koreans for more flexibility in how they deal with bone chips, cartilage and muscle membrane.\\nKorea\\'s major retailers are not placing orders for the U-S beef.\\nQuarantine authorities will take the next 10 days to inspect the first shipment for bone fragments.\\nBut Meat and Livestock Australia\\'s regional manager in Korea Glen Feist says Korean retail chains are not yet ready to welcome back US product.\\n\"Obviously over the last nearly three years now we\\'ve made very strong relationships with these guys and they\\'re all indicating to us that they\\'ll take a wait and see attitude as well,\" he said.\\n\\nNatural gas sector pushes for role in greenhouse gas fight\\nAustralia\\'s natural gas sector wants to know why it is not playing a greater role in the push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\\nThe Federal Government is funding two research projects in Queensland to extract methane from coal, with any carbon dioxide emissions to be buried underground.\\nBut the Australian Pipeline Industry Association has questioned the continued reliance on coal while renewable energy sources come on line.\\nChief executive Cheryl Cartwright says there is enough known natural gas reserves in Australia to last 100 years and it would make better environmental sense to start using it.\\n\"Instead of relying on coal fired generation in the immediate term and the medium term, we can start to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" she said.\\n\"Certainly not to the level that renewable energy provides, which is almost zero but natural gas greenhouse emissions in energy generation are far lower than coal.\"\\nFederal Resources Minister Ian Macfarlane says coal will remain a feature of global energy generation for the next century.\\nMr Macfarlane says Australia is leading the research into cleaner burning and emission technologies, and the natural gas sector should see itself as a part of that.\\n\"They\\'re promoting their side of the industry, the Government is promoting a broad mix, we need to make sure as we announce that mix we get it right,\" he said.\\n\\nSenate committee hears grain growers\\' concerns\\nThe Wheat Export Authority says it has not yet held talks with the Federal Government about increased powers to regulate wheat exports.\\nOfficers have told the Senate estimates agriculture committee that they expect the authority\\'s role to change in the wake of the Cole inquiry.\\nBut committee chairman, Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan has told the hearing that concern among growers over low pool payments and AWB\\'s service agreement, mean there is pressure to change the system.\\n\"It\\'s as if you\\'ve discovered a betrayal, a sense of betrayal, amongst a lot of wheat growers and to get the sense of betrayal, they say a picture paints a thousand words,\" he said.\\n\\nScientists want extra funding for CO2 storage projects\\nAustralian scientists are calling on the Federal Government to double its funding for projects which store carbon dioxide underground.\\nThe federal and state governments have announced a $2 billion low emission technology fund to help reduce emissions from coal, oil and gas mining.\\nPeter Cook from the CRC for Greenhouse Gas Technologies is helping to design Australia\\'s first project to store carbon dioxide in Victoria\\'s Otway Basin.\\nHe says the funding is not enough.\\n\"Almost half of Australia\\'s total emissions come from what we call stationary sources, in other words from power stations,\" he said.\\n\\nIrrigation pumping on unregulated streams stopped\\nThe drought has forced an early halt to irrigation pumping on unregulated streams and rivers in New South Wales.\\nThe Department of Natural Resources says it is unprecedented to see water levels fall so low in so many river systems this early in the season.\\nWater levels have reached precarious levels in southern, northern and far western regions, while in the central west pumping is expected to be halted within days.\\nSpokesman David Harris says he has never seen so many creeks and rivers drying up so early.\\n\"This year is just horrendous, we\\'ve just had no winter flow, we\\'ve had no spring flow and as a consequence most of the unregulated streams have just stopped flowing,\" he said.\\n\\nDrought aid assistance increased\\nThe New South Wales Government has announced further drought assistance for farmers and irrigators.\\nThe extra assistance will see drought aid increased to $30 million this financial year.\\nIrrigators in the Lachlan Valley will be the biggest winner from the announcement, with their fixed water charges waived this season, saving them around $5 million.\\nThe State Government has also extended its drought support workers program until June next year.\\nThe Premier has waived the wild dog destruction board fees for farmers in the western division and deferred the pest insect levy for this financial year.\\nNSW Premier Morris Iemma says they are also increasing mental health services.\\n\"There is a real human toll here. Extra stress, anxiety, indeed depression as farming families suffer as a result of losing their income,\" he said.\\n\\nNT cattle exports to Malaysia almost double\\nAlmost twice as many cattle are being exported from the Northern Territory to the Malaysian state of Sabah compared to last year.\\nAlmost 2,500 cattle have been sent out of the port of Darwin this year and the trade is expected to keep growing.\\nStuart Kenny from the NT Cattlemen\\'s Association has been at the opening a new Meat Technology Centre in Sabah, which he says will help to build the export business.\\n\"We are presently about 30 kilometres north of the main city in Sabah, which has seen a collaborative agreement between Sabah Government and also the NT Government,\" he said.\\n\"What we are seeing today is a first class facility that can meet the technology and the quality of meat that can be seen anywhere in Australia.\\n\\nBull sells for record price\\nThe record price for an Australian stud bull has been doubled at a brahman bull sale near Rockhampton.\\nA 20-month-old bull sold for $300,000 at the McCamley families\\' Tartrus Lancefield sale.\\nIt was bought by Graham Kemp from the Happy Valley Brahman stud at Mackay.\\nSpokesman Ken McCaffrey hopes other sons of the bull, JDH Baxter Manso, are as popular.\\n\"They sold particularly well the sons of Baxter\\'s through the sale but he was well credentialled in every way with pedigree and his group breed plan figures,\" Mr McCaffrey said.\\n\\nLabor hits out at pay rise for GRDC boss\\nThe Federal Government-funded Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) is under fire, for awarding its managing director a $60,000 pay rise during the drought.\\nThe GRDC has admitted to a Senate estimates hearings that managing director Peter Reading\\'s salary was increased to $460,000 this year, but says it was after a salary review by an independent body.\\nLabor\\'s agriculture spokesman Gavan O\\'Connor says the Government should be ashamed.\\n\"I think it\\'s important that some sensitivity in judgment is exercised when wage rises or salary rises of this kind are granted,\" he said.\\n\\nGrain growers urged not to accept low shares offer\\nThe Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF) is warning grain growers not to accept low offers for their shares in wheat exporter AWB.\\nThe Australian Share Purchasing Corporation is offering drought-hit farmers $1.50 for their B class shares.\\nIan Hastings from the VFF is worried that growers do not realise their shares are worth almost twice that amount.\\n\\nGrain harvest under way\\nThe grain harvest has commenced in Victoria\\'s Mallee and some grain growers say they are surprised by yields.\\nWith less than 100 millimetres of rain during the growing season, farmers have been expecting a small harvest.\\nIn the Millewa, in the state\\'s north-west, farmer Colin Hunt says some wheat crops are yielding up to one tonne per hectare, a bit above expectation.\\n\\nCanola crushers look to import crop\\nThe canola crop has now all but failed this season in New South Wales.\\nCanola crushers are currently looking at importing canola from Western Australia or Canada to meet the state\\'s domestic demand.\\nPete MacSmith from Macsmith Milling in the state\\'s central west says the local figures are not good.\\n\"The latest estimates are putting the NSW crop at somewhere between 25 and 35,000 tonnes,\" he said.\\n\"There\\'s been a few reasonable crops up in the north.\\n\"There will be very little harvested in the central west until we get down to the irrigation areas.\\n\\nDrought impacts on northern cattle prices\\nCattle prices in tropical northern Australia are feeling the impact of the dry conditions elsewhere.\\nAn oversupply of stock to the domestic markets is driving down prices across the nation and for the live export trade.\\nSteve Ellison, of the Territory\\'s Live Exporters Association, says cattle prices have eased by 10 to 15 cents for every kilogram sold.\\nHowever he says there has been a big improvement in the buffalo export trade.\\n\"I think price is a big factor, plus there are buffalo operators who are really well organised, they can get much bigger numbers on a regular basis and put them in yards and quieten them down prior to going on the ship,\" he said.\\n\\nQuarantined US beef released in Japan\\nCustoms officials in Japan have finally released 910 tonnes of US beef which has been in quarantine since January.\\nThe shipment was delayed when Japan reimposed a ban on US imports.\\nMeat and Livestock Australia\\'s Glen Feist says the problem now is that the beef only has an eight week shelf life.\\n\"The Japanese consumer is extremely discerning when it comes to quality and freshness of any meat,\" he said.\\n\"If consumer sentiment obviously is down over there against US beef a food service operator might buy this product and not be able to push it through either.\\n\\nSawmillers worried about long-term viability\\nTasmanian sawmillers are concerned that a downturn in the wood chip market could undermine their long-term viability.\\nForestry Tasmania\\'s annual report has revealed a 24 per cent fall in wood chip sales, and a 9 per cent reduction in sawlogs.\\nFred Ralph from the Country Sawmillers Federation blames the drop in saw log sales to the slow down in the construction of new homes.\\nBut he is concerned that when the industry recovers, mills will not be able to sell their wood chip residues.\\n\\nSA and NSW govts reach water trading agreement\\nThe South Australian and New South Wales governments have signed an agreement to allow cross-border trading of water entitlements from the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers.\\nEarlier this year the Federal Government threatened to fine the two states $17 million if they did not reach an agreement by January.\\nSouth Australian Minister for the River Murray Karlene Maywald is hopeful this deal will avoid any penalties.\\n\"We\\'ve come a long way since earlier this year in relation to the negotiations and the discussion,\" she said.\\n\\nCommission proposes increasing semi-trailer loads\\nLoad limits for semi-trailers could be increased by five tonnes under a draft proposal from the National Transport Commission.\\nTrucks with twin-steer axles would be able to carry a maximum gross weight of 47.5 tonnes.\\nThe commission says any additional damage to roads would be offset by higher registration charges.\\nSpokesman Paul Sullivan says the plan would result in productivity and safety gains for the logging, mining and construction industries.\\n\"It originally came from requests from industry in the logging, mining and construction industries that need to carry a little bit of extra mass,\" he said.\\n\\nAboriginal land subdivided for farming\\nIn a first for the Northern Territory, Aboriginal land has been subdivided for horticulture development.\\nIt has taken more than 10 years to develop the new leases due to a lack of funding.\\nFive blocks of between 100 to 1,000 hectares at Ti-Tree, north of Alice Springs, will be leased to farmers for development.\\nAllan Cooney from Centrefarm says the plan will increase the productivity of unimproved land, with plans to grow olives, mangoes, tablegrapes and bush tucker.\\n\"We would expect there to be fruit planted here next year, albeit on a relatively small scale but within a couple of years we\\'ll see extensive plantings in these areas,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve got people that have been lined up for years ready to go onto these sites.\\n\\nFarm hoping for canker-free future\\nOrchardists at Emerald in central Queensland are in the final stages of preparing for what is being called the most complex tree planting operation in Australia\\'s history.\\nA total of 193,000 citrus trees had to be destroyed at 2PH farms after canker was discovered in the region in 2004.\\nUnder a replacement project 5,000 trees will be planted every day for four months.\\nManager Craig Pressler is hoping for a canker-free future.\\n\\nEco City Farm wins invention of year award\\nAn urban food production system designed to reduce carbon emissions has won an invention of the year award in northern New South Wales.\\nThe Eco City Farm, which is on a standard house block, produces enough fish and vegetables to feed 300 families.\\nThe farm is designed to cut the emissions created by transporting food from rural areas to city consumers.\\nSpokesman Andrew Bodlovich says it produces no effluent, recycles its own water and is economically viable even at current city land values.\\n\"We really started out with the specific goal of achieving a triple bottom line with an agriculture system, so it really needed to work for profit but we also wanted it to be very ecological and it had to work for people as well,\" he said.\\n\\nMuster slows cane toads\\' progress\\nMore than 48,000 cane toads have been caught in the Timber Creek region of the Northern Territory.\\nA month-long campaign has been running in an attempt to stop the poisonous pest crossing the Western Australian border.\\nCoordinator Graeme Sawyer originally expected to catch around 10,000 but he is hopeful the Great Toad Muster has slowed the toad\\'s progress.\\n\\nRebound in wool prices expected to continue\\nWool prices are tipped to rise even further as competition for Australia\\'s drought-depleted wool stocks grows between Europe and Asia.\\nWools in the medium 21 to 23 micron range are at a five year high after jumping up to 44 cents a kilogram at yesterday\\'s sales.\\nOver the past three weeks the benchmark eastern market indicator has risen to a two-year-high.\\nChief economist at Woolmark Chris Wilcos says the rebound should continue for at least another two months.\\n\"We would expect to see a further rise of 10 to 15 per cent again, compared with what we\\'ve already seen in the last three weeks,\" he said.\\n\\nMixed response to water buying scheme\\nThere has been a mixed response to the launch of the Federal Government\\'s first scheme to buy water from farmers for the environment.\\nThe Government is offering to buy water from irrigators in the Southern Murray Darling Basin that is saved through on and off farm efficiency improvements.\\nSome irrigators say it will offer farmers a new source of income.\\nBut Danny Lee from the Victorian Irrigators Council says with little irrigation water available, governments should be spending more money on water saving infrastructure.\\n\"Right now we have a severe drought, nobody needs to be told that, farmers are on their knees, they are in a weakened state,\" he said.\\n\\nComplaint delays animal ID system audit\\nThere has been a six-week delay in an audit of Australia\\'s new electronic animal identification system.\\nThe audit was commissioned in July to investigate claims of inaccuracies and systemic errors in the system\\'s database.\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says an official complaint last month about the process has caused delays.\\nMeanwhile one of Australia\\'s biggest cattle producers has been fined for failing to electronically ear-tag his cattle.\\nDespite pleading guilty, the central Queensland-based Laglan Pastoral Company has hit back at the prosecution, saying ear-tags were not available.\\nThe company was charged with breaching Queensland\\'s new national livestock identification laws by trucking cattle between company properties without the ear-tags, which are designed to trace animals from paddock to plate.\\nSpokesman Charles Lund believes the $800 fine and conviction is unfair\\n\"The meatworks will tell you over 30 years we\\'ve never had a question come back from them and our cattlework and our paperwork\\'s been always spot on and they couldn\\'t find anything wrong with any of our paperwork or the traceability of our stock,\" he said.\\n\"What annoys me the most, that we\\'ve helped the DPI, we\\'ve helped the police, we\\'ve caught quite a lot of stolen cattle and that, and we\\'re all for cattle being correctly designated, but if you can\\'t get a product to put in them in the ear, you can\\'t put it in the ear.\"\\n\\nCanadian GM canola may be in Aust by year\\'s end\\nGenetically-modified (GM) canola from Canada could be imported into Australia by the end of the year.\\nIt is one of 40 applications to import grain and oilseeds to address feed shortages.\\nPeter Liehne from the Australian Quarantine Service has told the Senate Estimates Agriculture Committee that if the canola application succeeds, the oilseed will have to be crushed near the port of entry.\\nHe says the applicant plans to make the remaining meal into livestock feed.\\n\\nAWI court action costing woolgrowers\\nThe Federal Court has heard the Australian Wool Innovation\\'s legal action against the animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), has cost woolgrowers $5 million.\\nThe two-year-old case is a result of PETA\\'s campaign against mulesing.\\nBut at today\\'s hearing in Sydney, Justice Rares has asked how woolgrowers can claim indirect economic losses, when AWI has $100 million in the bank.\\nThe startling figures came out after PETA filed a strike-out motion against the woolgrowers\\' damages.\\nRod Smith SC told Justice Rares AWI and its co-applicants had made a series of \"forensic u-turns\".\\nMr Smith said he was intrigued to know how the 101 woolgrowers could prove they had suffered a loss of benefit in their levy when AWI had $100 million in its accounts last financial year.\\nMr Smith added the 2 per cent levy was a Commonwealth statutory figure determined in November 2003 before the court action began.\\nMr Bannon SC for AWI and the woolgrowers argued the strike-out motion was a shemozzle, saying if AWI had spent its legal fees in the PETA campaign on other things woolgrowers would be in a better position today.\\nJustice Rares ordered that AWI and the woolgrowers provide within seven days detailed particulars of the loss.\\n\\nCity residents rally around drought-stricken counterparts\\nCharities say there is growing support from city people wanting to help rural Australia through the drought.\\nQueensland-based Aussie Helpers

from St Vincent de Paul has started a rural task force to coordinate support in the ACT and New South Wales and says she only realised how bad it was when she visited rural Australia.\\n\"When I was asked to form this task force I thought what am I going to do, I don\\'t know anything about this drought, I live in Wollongong near the beach,\" she said.\\n\"So I drove to Broken Hill for their 100th anniversary, instead of flying I drove.\\n\"You can read it in the paper and you can think \\'oh that\\'s really bad\\' but actually seeing it and talking to people.\\n\"I mean some people on those farms have been there for generations and generations, what do they do?\"\\nMeanwhile farm workers are urging their bosses to be honest about the future of their jobs during the drought.\\nVictorian dairy farm worker Nat Watson says employees who are kept in the dark can become anxious about their job security.\\n\"They\\'re coming home stressed and its affecting their family life because they don\\'t know if there is going to be on food on the table tomorrow,\" he said.\\n\\nRecord October temps recorded in NSW\\nNew South Wales has recorded its hottest, driest October on record, following its hottest and driest September.\\nThe consequences have been devastating for the rural sector, with crop failures and feed, and water shortages forcing a huge sell off of stock.\\nMike Logan from the Bureau of Meteorology has the bad news.\\n\"Right across NSW temperatures were just more than three degrees above the historical average of 24.5 degrees and the rainfall\\'s unbelievably low,\" he said.\\n\"On average we only received 6.6 mm compared to the state average for October of 48.9.\\n\\nPrice rise to help potato growers\\nTasmanian potato growers have received their first price rise in six years.\\nProcessor McCain will pay growers $10 a tonne more for russet burbank varieties and $6 a tonne extra for other varieties.\\nGrower representative Phillip Beswick says the rise will help farmers facing a difficult season ahead.\\n\"It\\'s pretty significant, the company has recognised the hardship growers are going to be in this year with the problems with water and acquiring it, and the high costs that we\\'ve had in the last 12 months,\" he said.\\n\\nRobotic system to hasten grape vines pruning\\nUniversity students in Adelaide have a designed a robotic system which can hand prune grape vines four times faster than a human.\\nAlthough many grapes are mechanically pruned, premium varieties still need some hand pruning.\\nThrough GPS and computer imaging, the software can be programed to tell a machine with a mechanical arm, where and at what angles to make the cuts.\\nOne of the designers, Damien Mavroudis, says it has the potential to save growers time and money.\\n\\nHarvesting short crops challenges grain growers\\nGrain growers in Western Australia struggling with the dry season are now facing with another challenge, harvesting short crops.\\nGlen Riethmuller from the Department of Agriculture says farmers in the reliable cropping areas are not used to having such light crops.\\nHe says growers are experimenting with different ways to set up their harvesters, so they can reduce losses.\\n\"People have certainly been looking at that knife and particularly changing to the double density knife guards if they haven\\'t already got them,\" he said.\\n\\nRain dance invoked for drought relief\\nIn an effort to break the drought, a woman in South Australia who describes herself as an Aboriginal spiritual adviser, is planning to travel the country hosting rain dances.\\nInspired by a rain dance staged in the Victorian town of Ouyen in 2003, Angelina Harradine says she will help to organise community ceremonies.\\n\"Myself and my team will travel all over Australia,\" she said.\\n\"There are processes that are used, those processes are very sacred, they\\'re shared with people with respect.\\n\"I don\\'t sit down here and think this is all fun and games.\\n\\nYoung Aboriginal actor sought for outback epic\\nThe search is continuing for a young Aboriginal actor to star in a major outback motion picture.\\nDirector Baz Luhrmann\\'s sweeping romance and historical epic will star Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman.\\nFilming on the yet unnamed film is due to begin early next year across Top End station country and he says time is running out to find the third character.\\n\"Now what brings them together though is this child and there an Aboriginal boy between the ages of eight and 10,\" Luhrmann said.\\n\"He\\'s a very, very primary character and in fact right at the moment, that\\'s my biggest focus.\\n\"We are looking all over Australia for this young Indigenous actor and we have seen some great boys so far, so we have got great possibilities.\\n\\nFrost hits apple crop\\nA quarter of the apple crop in central western New South Wales has been lost, as a result of weekend frosts.\\nThe cold snap hit the Orange region, damaging apples, apricots and cherries.\\nBatlow producers have also lost around 5 per cent of their crop.\\nOrange district apple grower Adam Roweth says he lost about half his crop, when the temperature plummeted to minus two.\\n\"I thought I had a problem in one of the blocks,\" he said.\\n\"The fruit wasn\\'t seen to be growing, but it wasn\\'t because it wasn\\'t growing, it was because it was frosted.\\n\"I have never seen frost that way, in that condition and that bad in my time which isn\\'t very old but I can assure you that I don\\'t think my father would have seen it like that either.\\n\\nAWB cuts wheat pool management costs\\nWheat exporter AWB has slashed its costs for managing the national wheat pool this financial year.\\nThe company says it is an attempt to maximise returns to grain growers during the drought and reduce administrative costs.\\nThe base fee AWB charges for managing the pool will be cut by 40 per cent to $39.5 million.\\nChairman of AWB International Ian Donges says the new business model will benefit growers.\\n\"It means the cost per tonne will come under $10, providing we get four million tonnes,\" he said.\\n\"I think that\\'s a very good result given that in the last drought in 2002 that $10 per tonnes was around about the base rate that growers paid as well.\\n\\nGovt considers drought aid for rural businesses\\nThe Deputy Prime Minister says the Federal Government is now considering extending drought assistance to farm-dependent businesses.\\nRural businesses say they have been hit just as hard by the drought and cannot keep going without support.\\nMark Vaile says measures are being considered to try to keep young people on the land and to ensure businesses survive.\\n\"Circumstances have been presented to us where there are directly agricultural-related small businesses, like harvesting contractors, spray contractors, that are being significantly affected in many EC [exceptional circumstances] areas,\" he said.\\n\\nFruit canning company offers drought help to farmers\\nAustralia\\'s biggest fruit canning company is offering extra drought assistance to growers to shore up supplies for the summer.\\nSPC Ardmona is offering suppliers in Victoria\\'s Goulburn Valley a $1.7 million package.\\nManaging director Nigel Garrard says the package includes loans, access to water and extra payments for fruit.\\n\"It\\'s three prongs to it, firstly, is interest free loans to enable them to buy water because we recognise a number of them need some help with the funding of the water,\" he said.\\n\"Secondly, are subsidies on fruit delivered to us and that\\'ll be for fruit and tomatoes.\\n\\nPatchy rainfall welcomed across NSW\\nInland New South Wales has received its most widespread rainfall in more than three months.\\nFalls over the past 24 hours have been patchy, with 50 millimetres in the state\\'s north but nothing in some central and western districts.\\nBut farmers in the central west say any rain is welcome.\\n\"We had 26 millimetres in two storms. One yesterday afternoon and one sometime early this morning,\" one farmer said.\\n\"Certainly some of our later paddocks, which we were saving for seed, it will help them. It won\\'t help the yield but it will help the grain size.\"\\nAnother farmer said: \"Two storms, one yesterday afternoon, 24 millimetres in 15 minutes and didn\\'t it come down.\"\\n\"Two storms, one yesterday afternoon with five millimetres and then another one about 4:00am (AEDT), and we picked up 16 millimetres. A little bit of heavy stuff in it,\" a third farmer said.\\n\"[We got] about half a millimetre, we can\\'t measure anything under that,\" a fourth farmer said.\\n\\nSpeed limit caps punish remote families: resident\\nRemote residents in the Northern Territory are outraged at Government plans to cap open speed limits.\\nBy the end of next year, all travellers on the Stuart, Arnhem, Barkly and Victoria Highways will have to stick to a 130 kilometre an hour limit.\\nAll other roads will have a 110 kilometre per hour cap.\\nJo Coulthard from Orange Creek Station, south of Alice Springs, says the changes punish remote families.\\n\"I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be upheld because how are they going to police it?\" she said.\\n\"We would have to take more time to do the travelling, which of course when you are working or living on a station you don\\'t have a lot of time to be doing that sort of stuff.\\n\"I think that\\'s going to have a huge impact on us. Instead of just being an overnight trip... now it will have to be a couple of nights.\\n\\nScientist pessimistic about alternative fuel in Aust\\nAustralia\\'s chief scientist does not think alternative fuels have a big future in the country because of a shortage of available production land.\\nDr Jim Peacock made the comments ahead of the Australian Farm Institute\\'s strategic round table meeting on agriculture in Sydney today.\\nThe conference is examining how science will assist agriculture over the next decade, especially in the areas of climate change, GM technology and strengthening international markets.\\nDr Peacock says people must be realistic about the potential offered by the alternative energy source.\\n\"There\\'s a lot of talk about agriculture and biofuels, I personally don\\'t think that\\'s going to be of very much significance in Australia,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s just a question of available land, production land.\\n\"There\\'s no doubt that ethanol is useful as a blend et cetera, but they\\'ll be part of the portfolio.\\n\\nCountry students falling behind in maths, science\\nPrimary school principals says rural students are falling behind in maths and science because of a shortage of teachers.\\nThe National Centre of Science and Maths says country pupils fall further behind city students, the further they live from a major city.\\nLeonie Trimper from the Australian Primary Principals Association says rural schools need specific funding to help them attract and keep specialist teachers.\\n\\nTV station operator pushes for rural channel\\nThe operators of a rural community television station say the Federal Government is ignoring requests for a new digital TV station dedicated to rural Australia.\\nSouth Australian-based BushVision says in a national survey of 250 people, more than 90 per cent believed rural issues were not covered adequately by mainstream TV networks and almost all supported a dedicated rural channel.\\nThe Federal Government wants digital technology to replace the current analogue network within six years.\\nBushVision station manager Leon Ashby there is good reasons for a rural channel.\\n\"For many years, our information and our news has either been sensationalised and it puts a picture of rural Australians always whingeing, always got a flood or a fire, or some catastrophe,\" he said.\\n\"But it doesn\\'t give the overall picture that there\\'s a lot of good things happening.\\n\"We talked about better communications for the bush but television has been left completely out of the picture.\"\\n\\nTough decisions facing irrigators\\nSouth Australia\\'s peak irrigators body says some farmers may not survive the latest cut in water allocations.\\nRiver Murray water entitlements have been cut from 70 to 60 per cent after another month of record low inflows across the Murray Darling Basin.\\nIan Zadow from SA Murray Irrigators says some will have to make tough decisions in the coming weeks.\\n\"I\\'m sure that this is going to create real problems for a lot of irrigators,\" he said.\\n\\nAnthrax season starts early\\nNew South Wales has had an early start to the anthrax season, with two properties already suffering stock losses.\\nThe state normally sees about four cases of stock losses from anthrax each year.\\nCatherine Taragel from the Department of Primary Industries says, \"we have had an early start to the summer period and we have started to see anthrax cases,\" she said.\\n\\nDry forces cattle sell-off\\nOne of the biggest cattle stations in the world has been forced to sell 12,000 head as the dry continues.\\nAnna Creek Station in South Australia\\'s far north has reduced its stock levels from 16,000 head to 4,000 since late last year.\\nManager Randall Crozier says most of the cattle have been sold or sent to feedlots.\\n\"We\\'ve been destocking pretty well since November last year and we\\'re pretty well in full swing now we\\'re down,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re down to approximately less than a quarter of our stocking rate at the moment and if it doesn\\'t rain soon, there\\'ll be even less than that.\\n\\nSoybean producers buoyed by higher prices\\nHigher prices have led soybean producers on the New South Wales north coast to plan their biggest crop plantings in years.\\nGrowers are being offered an opening price of $380 a tonne for beans for the crushing market.\\nBuyers agent Kerry Handford says the drought has played a part in the price jump, but it is mainly due to growing interest in biofuels.\\n\"I think that\\'s starting to put a bit of a surge in everything,\" he said.\\n\"They can use the oil in a biodiesel situation because the soybean produces 20 per cent of its mass in oil.\\n\"And also our food chains are getting away from solid fats into oils to do their cooking for health reasons.\\n\\nDeadline for Wool Poll vote\\nToday is the last chance for wool growers to vote on the level of their industry levy.\\nWool Poll is run every three years to determine funding levels for research and development, marketing and grower services.\\nGrowers currently pay a levy

breeding season.\\nKoorana Crocodile Farms\\' John Lever says storms have brought falls of more than 200 millimetres, which has ignited passion in his reptiles\\nHe says it is the earliest egg lay they have ever had.\\n\"We were quite amazed that there was a bit of hanky panky going on there but no great surge of sexual desire,\" he said.\\n\"But we got a good spread of rain over about three days and that really got them going then.\\n\\nCattle prices recover\\nCattle prices have made a slight recovery as supply tightens across the country.\\nBut there is a big discrepancy between livestock yardings and the number of both cattle and sheep being slaughtered at abattoirs.\\nPeter Weeks from Meat and Livestock Australia says many buyers who have enjoyed good patchy rain are still buying stock or choosing to grain feed.\\n\"We\\'re seeing yardings about 30 per cent up year on year both for cattle and for lambs at the moment,\" he said.\\n\"And yet the slaughter side only up about 5 per cent for both.\\n\\nRain boosts cotton planting areas\\nMore cotton will be planted in south-east Queensland after some of the best rain all year.\\nA band of rain and isolated thunderstorms crossed the region over the weekend with 102 millimetres recorded at Warwick, 64 at Kingaroy and 51 at Warra.\\nWhile some of the state\\'s most drought-affected areas missed out, Darling Downs cotton grower Ian Speed says he can now double his crop planting.\\n\"We\\'ll be able to plant some dryland cotton now, we\\'d only had about a hundred hectares of cotton that we\\'d pre-watered and now we\\'ll put in probably another 200 hectares of cotton,\" he said.\\n\\nRain expected to boost locust numbers\\nFarmers in Western Australia\\'s wheatbelt received significant rainfall from thunderstorms at the weekend but it is creating problems for growers trying to harvest crops.\\nFalls of between 15 and 20 millimetres were recorded on average but there are now concerns the rain will cause an increase in locust numbers.\\nEntomologist Kevin Walden says the rain will give the current locust plague a boost.\\n\"The adult locusts will survive well now,\" he said.\\n\"They\\'ll move probably larger distances than they normally would if they didn\\'t have any rainfall and there definitely is the possibility of an air glade.\\n\\nUranium exploration companies booming\\nAustralian uranium exploration companies are booming due to the increasing international focus on cleaner energy production.\\nRecent floats have been heavily over-subscribed and have closed early, while many stocks are doubling their issue price in a single day of trading.\\nInvestment manager with broking house ASANDAS Mark Niutta believes public attitudes to uranium mining are changing.\\n\\nWA potato growers urged to pull their spuds early\\nPotato growers in Western Australia are being asked to pull their spuds before they have reached full yield production due to looming shortages.\\nA lack of processing potatoes in the eastern states due to drought and frosts earlier in this year has led to a surge in demand.\\nPresident of the WA Vegetable Growers Association Jim Turley says because growers have been asked to harvest earlier, they should be paid more.\\n\"It is tight all round Australia. The growers are under pressure with their costs going up all the time,\" he said.\\n\\nAerial contractors look to cut costs\\nThe drought is expected to cut rice production in southern New South Wales by 80 per cent to 200,000 tonnes.\\nThe crop is normally being sown by plane at this time of the year but aerial contractors are reporting a big downturn in business.\\nPhil Sefton from Field Air at Deniliquin has not employed casual staff this season and is looking at other ways to cut costs.\\n\"There\\'s not many businesses out there that could say if they lost 95 per cent of their work they\\'d be in a very financial position,\" he said.\\n\\nStud breeders seek govt assistance\\nStud breeders in the cattle industry say they are worried about the loss of valuable genetics, unless they receive drought assistance.\\nMany do not qualify for Federal Government support because of high off-farm incomes.\\nThe industry says most of that income is being used to support stud properties during the drought.\\nCentral Victorian murray grey breeder Marilyn Pell says she is going into serious debt but doesn\\'t want to have to sell cows to abattoirs.\\n\"I\\'ve paid up to $2,500 just for one cow because she was a well bred cow with her genetics,\" she said.\\n\"If I was to send her in now to get her head cut off you know I\\'d be lucky to get $400.\\n\\nGovt playing catch-up on water policy, says Labor\\nLabor has attacked the Federal Government for not doing enough to prepare the country for drought.\\nThe Prime Minister will hold a water crisis meeting with four state governments tomorrow to look at critical storage levels in the Murray Darling River system and the implications for irrigators.\\nThe Murray Darling Basin received just 3.2 millimetres of rain last month, the lowest rainfall since records began.\\nOpposition agriculture and fisheries spokesman Gavan O\\'Connor says the Coalition is playing catch-up on policy.\\n\"Labor proposed a summit on climate change and water some two years ago and that suggestion was met with derision by the Government,\" he said.\\n\"Now with the Murray Darling Basin in a state of stress, systems not having enough water to meet farmers needs and some farmers allocations down to 30 per cent some not at all, the Government has decided to act. It\\'s simply not good enough.\"\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGuaran says the current dry conditions are no-one\\'s fault and steps have been taken to manage low water levels.\\nIrrigators from the Murray Darling Basin say environmental flows should be used to boost city water shortages.\\nThe lobby group, Irrigators Australia Limited, has put forward a five point plan to the Federal Government looking at how to deal with the water crisis.\\nChairman Barry Croke says governments should reduce water flows for the environment, instead of buying water off farmers.\\n\"Irrigators\\' water is needed to feed people and we think that\\'s very, very important but urban use when it starts competing with irrigation water in this time of real scarcity, it\\'s creating an enormous problem to produce food,\" he said.\\n\"So environmental water is there and normally the gum trees wouldn\\'t be getting environmental water in this situation and we just believe urbans ought to be supplemented by environmental water.\"\\n\\nPumping water\\nCalls to pump water from northern Australia to the south has received support from a US scientist, who says similar projects have solved water shortages there.\\nProfessor Scott Bassett from the Desert Research Institute in Nevada says water in rivers and underground basins is worth big money.\\nHe says in the US water is being piped from farming areas to cities because population growth is outstripping water supplies.\\n\"Water moves uphill and it moves uphill to money. Big cities will pay for their water supply in such a way as $3 billion canals from Phoenix to the Colorado River so they\\'ll ship the water from the Colorado River to cities like Phoenix which has the base to supply the economic drive to get the water up there,\" he said.\\nBut former Californian farmer Spike Dessert, who now lives in the Kimberley, says the distance water is piped in the US does not compare with Australia.\\nHe says some pumping schemes are just 300 kilometres long, nothing compared to the thousands of kilometres of pipeline that would be needed here.\\n\\nExpert wants dingo controls relaxed\\nThere has been a call to relax controls on dingoes and even reintroduce them in some parts of Australia.\\nIn a new book, Professor Chris Johnson of James Cook University says it is important to conserve the pure-bred dingo.\\nHe says he understands the damage wild dogs cause to livestock but argues the dingo is a natural predator of other ferals .\\n\\nSponge cake cook-off whips up competition\\nThe men of north-west Tasmania have proved a dab hand in the kitchen, whipping up frenzied competition at a weekend sponge cake cook-off.\\nFourteen cooks lined up for the men-only competition at the Ulverstone Show on Saturday.\\nEntrant Barry Smith says he had a novel way of making sure there was enough air in his cake mixture.\\n\\nHigh rabbit numbers worry graziers\\nGraziers are concerned that high rabbit numbers will hinder the recovery of pastoral country after the drought.\\nDavid Lord of Thackaringa station near Broken Hill says he is concerned that the calicivirus is losing its impact in controlling rabbit populations.\\nMr Lord is calling for a complete stocktake of what is going on with rabbits and control methods.\\n\"General talk around the bush [is] that rabbit numbers increased over the last six months,\" he said.\\n\"Definitely need some finance to support a scientific team to get a good handle on RHD so we know whether any resistance is developing.\\n\\nRural Aust fairly protected from interest rate rise: NAB\\nRural Australia is expected to ride out any further interest rate rise better than most.\\nThe National Australia Bank (NAB) says many farmers have locked their loans into fixed rates to guard against a rise.\\nIt is widely tipped the Reserve Bank will announce an increase of a quarter of a per cent tomorrow.\\nThe NAB\\'s general manager of agribusiness, Wayne Carlson, says the farm sector is managing its financial commitments much better.\\n\"Of our agricultural loan book there is something in excess of 70 per cent of that managed on fixed rate or capped rate, or with interest rate risk management tools if you like applied to assist,\" he said.\\n\\nWA export holding yards breaching standards: RSPCA\\nThe RSPCA says most live export holding yards in Western Australia breach new national quarantine standards.\\nThe animal welfare body is investigating what it says is a lack of shelter at one of the state\\'s biggest ports at Wyndham.\\nIt says cattle, goats and pigs are forced to stand in temperatures of more than 40 degrees for up to three days without shade.\\nSince the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) standards are not enforceable, the RSPCA wants the owner of the yards, the Ord River District Co-operative, to provide shelter.\\nBut spokesman Jim Hughes says that is unlikely to happen.\\nMr Hughes says the facilities are not part of their core business and they do not receive enough rent to warrant upgrading the 80-year-old yards.\\n\"What we get for those cattle yards is no more than a donation,\" he said.\\n\"In those circumstances why on earth would we want to spend a lot of money on facilities at the yard?\"\\nThe new AQIS export standards state registered premises must provide animals with protection from extreme climatic conditions.\\nBut RSPCA prosecutor Robin Moore says he was told the standards are not enforceable.\\n\\nJapan pressured to lift age limit on beef imports\\nThe US Government is pressuring Japan to lift its age limit on beef imports.\\nJapan has agreed to accept beef from animals under the age of 20 months in the wake of the outbreak of mad cow disease in the US in 2003.\\nBut US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns says the 20 month limit is too restrictive and not the international standard.\\n\\nUranium price expected to rise\\nThe price of uranium continues to climb steadily, with predictions it could hit $US100 a pound by next year.\\nIt is currently sitting at $US60, up from just $US10 five years ago.\\nANZ Bank commodities analyst Andrew Harrington does not think the price will go quite so high but says demand is far outstripping supply.\\nHe says there are 50 nuclear power reactors being planned around the world and the supply of uranium from old nuclear weapons is drying up.\\n\"Nuclear weapons, the linchpin in supply for a long time but recycled nuclear bombs are fewer and fewer between in the old Soviet Union and the United States,\" he said.\\n\\nDairy co-op lifts milk prices\\nA dairy co-operative on the north coast of New South Wales is lifting milk prices to help farmers pay higher costs for grain to feed their cows.\\nThe Norco Dairy Co-op will pay producers just over four cents a litre extra from January.\\nChairman Greg McNamara says there is likely to be a major shortage of milk by autumn if farmers are not given support to maintain their herds.\\n\"We\\'re extremely concerned about the cost impact of grain on farmers and how that\\'s actually seeing (a) farmers actually leaving and (b) the current farming supply left is using less grain and getting less milk,\" he said.\\n\\nIrrigators await summit decisions on Murray Darling\\nThe Federal Government says it will decide in the next few weeks what action will be taken to help the ailing Murray Darling Basin.\\nIt has been meeting with four state governments this morning to thrash out ways to salvage river system.\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says if there is a repeat of this year\\'s dry conditions there will be an extreme water crisis across the basin.\\nBut he says the governments have not yet decided whether they will compulsorily buy back water rights from irrigators to shore up town water supplies.\\n\"Those are the hard decisions that we will prepare for next year,\" he said.\\n\"We still hope obviously the drought will break but if it doesn\\'t then there are going to be difficult decisions and people need to be reassured that all governments are working together on this.\\n\"We\\'re going to take action on contingency planning, we\\'ll commission a survey of towns and cities\\' water supply situations, what options are available to us.\"\\nThe National Farmers Federation says rural towns should be made a priority when it comes to water distribution.\\nBut chief executive Ben Fargher is worried the decision-makers will not take into consideration the huge investment irrigators make in their water allocations.\\n\"We do want a process set up to make sure that we can protect our core breeding stock, which is our productive base,\" he said.\\n\"How do we protect those permanent plantings, those crops like orchards and other plantings that take a long-long time to establish.\"\\nMeanwhile irrigators in southern New South Wales are anxiously waiting to hear if there will be further cuts to their current water allocations.\\nThe New South Wales Department of Natural Resources has suspended trade in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys to assess how much water there is for irrigators.\\nThe department\\'s David Harriss says the review has been prompted by record low inflows into storages in the Snowy Mountains.\\n\"That gives Snowy Hydro the capacity to reduce what they call the required releases into the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys,\" he said.\\n\\nNT fruit growers bemoan lost Cup sales\\nNorthern Territory fruit growers are hoping to have better luck on the horses today after missing out on lucrative sales for the Cup carnival.\\nThe star fruit, also known as carambola, commands up to $60 a tray at this time of year.\\nThat is more than double the price received outside of the racing calendar.\\nDarwin growers like Cheryl are hoping to get the crop back on track for Christmas.\\n\"It\\'s used a lot in garnishes and in salads,\" she said.\\n\"We had a problem earlier on in the year with late rains, early cool temperatures and it just delayed everything - we are about three weeks late with the season for this time of year.\\n\\nTas company builds vineyard bio-protection mould\\nA Tasmanian company is developing a biological fungicide to control grey mould in vineyards.\\nBiocontrol Australia has won a Federal Government grant to commercialise the fungicide.\\nDr Dean Metcalf says field trials have reduced the amount of grapes lost to the disease by 80 per cent.\\nHe says the biological fungicide works with the help of a micro-organism that is native to Tasmania.\\n\\nGood rain benefits Kangaroo Is beekeepers\\nBeekeepers on South Australia\\'s Kangaroo Island are having one of the best honey seasons they have experienced in years.\\nLocal apiarist Peter Davis says the large volume of honey is the result of good rains in autumn and early winter which helped set the flower buds.\\nHe also says the dry mild winter kept the bees healthy and active.\\n\\nMuswellbrook races cancelled because of heavy track\\nRacegoers in the heart of thoroughbred breeding industry, the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, do not know whether to laugh or cry today.\\nDespite being drought-stricken, the local track was soaked by rain earlier this week, causing the traditional cup day race meeting to be cancelled.\\nIt is normally the biggest event of the year.\\nThe Muswellbrook Races are as well known to the racing industry as the Melbourne Cup and attract some of the best race horses from across New South Wales.\\nConditions were so dry in September and October however, that the club fertilised and watered the track to soften it up but recent heavy falls have now made it too heavy for racing.\\n\\nDrought hits horse racing studs\\nHorse racing studs in Victoria say they are being hard hit by the drought.\\nA lack of spring rains has meant stud owners are buying in feed early this year instead of usually holding off until summer.\\nFiona Smith from Nagambie, in central Victoria, says studs are being forced to pass the costs on to customers.\\n\"We\\'ve had an increase in feed, feed prices are astronomical at the moment and are affecting us quite badly in regards to the cost of everything,\" she said.\\n\"Unfortunately we\\'ve had to increase a drought levy fee onto our agistment so therefore owners are incurring extra costs.\"\\nMeanwhile country race clubs in New South Wales are concerned about their future viability.\\nOrange-based trainer Brian Cornish says low prizemoney, increased feed costs and high fuel prices are hurting.\\n\"We\\'re trying to get more money here. Everyone is working hard to try and get it for us,\" he said.\\n\"That is the only way we will survive on the cost of living here today and training horses.\\n\"The expense of it is getting astronomical now. The thing of it is they want all the money to go to Sydney. That\\'s where they want the money for them down there, they\\'re not worried about us very much here.\\n\\nCalicivirus having an impact around Alice\\nResearch is showing that a re-release of the rabbit killing calicivirus is having an effect near Alice Springs.\\nRabbit numbers have increased dramatically in recent years, amid fears the disease is losing its effectiveness.\\nKym Schwartzkopff from Parks and Wildlife says a number of rabbits have died since the re-release, but the disease has not spread as far as hoped.\\n\"The main stop of the spread is usually caused through weather, it does seem to work a lot better within a mild climate where it\\'s a lot cooler and a bit more humidity around and a bit more moisture around and the high temperatures that we have in the centre of Australia and also through the desert regions make it go dormant.\\n\\nGiant Qld dam falls to record low\\nOne of Queensland\\'s largest dams has now fallen to its lowest level yet.\\nFairbairn Dam at Emerald supplies 200,000 megalitres of water each year for irrigation, industrial and urban needs.\\nWhen full the dam holds 1.3 million megalitres, but today it is at just 14 per cent of capacity.\\nNev Wogand from Sunwater says it would take an exceptional wet season to fill the dam.\\n\\nDrought prompts call for seed law changes\\nA South Australian farmer wants the rules on Plant Breeders Rights (PBR) to be relaxed, so growers can donate seed to struggling colleagues.\\nNew grain varieties are subject to the rules, which prohibit growers from selling or even giving away the seed.\\nChris Lawrie from Tumby Bay says the seed companies should waive the ban this year, given the magnitude of the drought.\\n\"Why can\\'t they come out publicly and say well okay, if we either give or sell seed to somebody that we notify them of the amount of tonnes we\\'ve sold, who we\\'ve sold it to, then they\\'ve got a record of it all,\" he said.\\n\\nGrain-fed cattle numbers down\\nThe number of grain-fed cattle in Australia fell by nearly 60,000 head in the last quarter, due to skyrocketing grain prices and the worsening drought.\\nFigures from the Australian Lot Feeders Associations show a drop in total numbers from 940,000 to just over 880,000, with the biggest drop in Queensland.\\nAssociation president Malcolm Foster says South Australia was the only state to buck the trend, with numbers jumping 10,000 to 27,000.\\n\"There\\'s a lot of cattle that have come out of feedlots that have gone to profitable markets. Not all of them have been replaced,\" he said.\\n\"If feedlots can\\'t make the sums work between the price they can get for the cattle when they\\'re turning off, and the price they\\'ve got to pay for the cattle coming in with the current grain price, then they\\'ll just slow up their purchases of cattle and so you\\'ll see reduced demand and the ultimate outcome of that is falling cattle prices.\"\\nMeanwhile, Tasmania\\'s only feedlot is looking to import two thirds of its grain this year due to the poor growing season.\\nThe Powranna feedlot usually buys more than 20,000 tonnes of grain from Tasmanian growers, but after frosts and a dry season less than half that amount is available.\\nManaging director Andrew Thompson says the company is looking to the mainland to make up the shortfall.\\n\\nSupply shortages felt in pig meat industry\\nCompetition between pig meat processors is heating up in the lead up to Christmas because of supply shortages.\\nAs a result the market has risen to record highs this week, with liveweight prices as high as $3.20 per kilogram.\\nGreg Richter from Primo Meats at Port Wakefield, in South Australia, says the shortage has been caused by hot conditions last summer.\\n\"There\\'s been a bit of a general infertility problem that happened earlier in the year and that\\'s just starting to come through now, it always shows up about nine months after they have the problem,\" he said.\\n\\nUS wheat industry facing export problems\\nDespite a boost from Australia\\'s drought, the US wheat industry is facing widespread export problems due to quality and disease issues.\\nIndia is buying wheat again for the first time in seven years, but mostly from Australia and the Black Sea region, not the US.\\n\"It\\'s because their phytosanitary requirement just can\\'t be met. It just creates an impossible barrier to trade,\" said US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns,\\nUSDA is working with US Wheat Associaties to reduce these barriers.\\nBut the group\\'s Rebecca Coleman says quality and disease issues are \"cropping up\" elsewhere.\\n\"We\\'re having trouble in the EU, we\\'re having trouble in Japan, I\\'m sure we\\'re going to have trouble in Korea. We\\'re having trouble right now in Kenya,\" she said.\\nMs Coleman says sanitary barriers are now threatening to become more of a problem for US wheat in some places than tariffs.\\nMeanwhile, the Grains Council of Australia says a national survey of grain quality shows it is almost 100 per cent clean.\\nThe National Residue Survey of Australian grain, a joint government and industry project, revealed that 99.9 per cent of grain for export complied with Australian Food Standards.\\n\\nFunding shortage kills weed research centre\\nThe Co-operative Research Centre for Weeds will close by 2008, after failing to win further Federal Government funding.\\nThe national research and development body had sought an additional $30 million funding over seven years, but failed to meet three out of the four necessary criteria.\\nChief executive Rachel Mcfadyen says it is a disastrous result because climate change will bring on fresh weed invasions.\\n\"Some of the northern weeds will move south, as the temperature heats up so in particular for example prickly acacia, mesquite in the grazing lands will extend their range southwards to western New South Wales and possibly even in Western Australia,\" she said.\\n\"Things like lantana along the coast will extend its range southward and we do offer advice as to how best manage those weeds and how to limit their spread.\"\\n\\nNew smut fears in Qld\\nTests are underway to confirm whether the disease sugar cane smut has escaped from a quarantine zone in Queensland.\\nThe State Government is expected to announce today that scientists are testing what\\'s being called \"suspicious substance\", as smut inspection teams survey 600 farms around Mackay.\\nSmut was first found near Bundaberg in June, and authorites had thought it was contained.\\nThe Canegrowers Organisation is refusing to confirm that the disease has escaped quarantine, but has confirmed testing is underway.\\n\\nMixed reaction to drought aid\\nThere has been a mixed reaction to the Federal Government\\'s announcement of drought aid for small businesses reliant on the farm sector.\\nBusinesses which receive 70 per cent of their income from farms in drought-declared areas will be eligible for income support and interest rate subsidies.\\nThe Australian Grain Harvest Association says it will help contractors struggling to make repayments on machinery.\\nBut spokesman Rob Gribble is now urging the government to help contractors prepare for future droughts, by setting up a version of the Farm Management Deposit (FMD) scheme.\\n\"In the long term what we request from the Federal Government is some sort of FMD facility so we can deposit money in good times and draw them out in bad and hopefully self manage our way through these things,\" he said.\\nFarm machinery dealers say they have been unfairly excluded from the new drought assistance package.\\nVin Delahunty from the Tractor and Machinery Association says most dealers will not be eligible for aid, because they employ more than 20 people.\\n\"Once again the significant employers in the regional areas, the people who employ the most significant number of skills in those communities, have been left out and to be honest, we don\\'t understand why the Government has taken this action.\"\\nIrrigators say they are skeptical of plans to speed up interstate water trading to address critical water shortages in drought-hit states.\\nThe federal and state governments have agreed that interstate buying and selling of permanent water rights will begin on January 1.\\nBut George Warne from Australia\\'s biggest irrigation company, Murray Irrigation, says there is little water available to ease shortages, because farmer allocations are so low.\\n\"I think it was good they got together, but I\\'m as a bit of a loss to understand how permanent water trading is going to help the drought,\" he said.\\n\\nNew family day care system helps outback NT families\\nOutback families in the Northern Territory are taking advantage of a new system of family day care.\\nThe Federal Government lifted the cap on family day care positions earlier this year.\\nIt has resulted in more opportunities for approved carers, and parents can claim a child care benefit.\\nIn the Douglas Daly, south-west of Darwin, mothers like Sarah, says it is becoming easier to juggle the farm and small children.\\n\"We do claim the CCB (Child Care Benefit), which is a fantastic help,\" she said.\\n\\nCCC investigates further misconduct\\nWestern Australia\\'s Corruption and Crime Commission (CCC) has revealed it has further evidence of serious misconduct and abuse of power by public officers.\\nThe revelation follows yesterday\\'s startling evidence at the CCC of secretly recorded phone conversations between the former minister Norm Marlborough and the former premier Brian Burke.\\nThe CCC inquiry was originally set up to investigate the handling of a proposal to build a tourist resort at Smiths Beach, near Yallingup.\\nBut the uncovering of secret phone conversations between Mr Marlborough and Mr Burke has now changed the nature and course of the inquiry.\\nYesterday CCC lawyer Stephen Hall SC revealed the commission had for some time been undertaking broader investigations.\\nHe said the investigations supported the proposition that serious misconduct by public officers has, may have, or is occurring.\\nMr Hall said the investigation had been given the highest priority because of the need to protect the integrity of government in Western Australia.\\n\\nAWB\\'s wheat export decision \\'disgraceful\\'\\nThere has been an angry reaction to AWB\\'s decision to block 12 applications to export more than 3 million tonnes of wheat.\\nThe applications were by several companies looking to export to eight countries but AWB has used its veto powers under the Wheat Marketing Act to prevent the move.\\nChairman of AWB International Ian Donges says the decision will protect the financial interests of wheat growers delivering grain to the National Pool.\\n\"Quite clearly, if we were to accept the permits that total 3 million tonnes this year we would be derelict in our duty,\" he said.\\n\"We are now looking at a potential harvest or a pool delivery of 4 million tonnes so it\\'s very important to maximise those pool returns that we have every tonne available to service the international market place.\"\\nBut WA-based grain handler CBH has described AWB\\'s decision as disgraceful.\\nThe co-operative wanted to export wheat to its South-East Asian flour mills.\\nIt is the second time CBH has been knocked back and chief executive Imre Mencshely says AWB has again jeopardised the future of growers in the west.\\n\"We cannot understand how an organisation can hide behind legislation to make a decision of this nature,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve come out and we\\'ve said that we can do this on a regular basis and we\\'ve said we\\'ll be out there for five years.\\n\"To deny the growers of Western Australian $40 million to $50 million in a year of drought, we just cannot comprehend an organisation coming out in that way.\"\\nThe Federal Government says it will not be pressured into changing the single desk wheat export system before the outcome of the oil-for-food inquiry.\\nSome Coalition MPs are calling for AWB\\'s veto power to be removed but Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says that will not happen yet.\\n\"AWB and other bulk handlers and other interested parties all know that,\" he said.\\n\\nTransport sector calls for better infrastructure\\nThe trucking industry says new laws to reduce driver fatigue must be accompanied by major government spending on roads.\\nThe National Transport Commission has released the final version of its plans to reduce driving hours and increase penalties in a bid to improve safety.\\nWhile many concerns with the commission\\'s initial recommendations have been addressed, the transport sector says better infrastructure is needed.\\nStuart St Clair from the Australian Trucking Association says drivers can not meet new rest break requirements unless 21,000 new rest areas are built.\\n\"It\\'s very difficult to put an onus on the trucking industry and its drivers to perform to the necessary regulations, that\\'s one thing and we accept that responsibility,\" he said.\\n\\nDemocrats\\' victory makes trade deals harder: consultant\\nWith the Democrats sweeping back into power in the US Congress, the Bush administration faces a major challenge to its power to broker trade deals next year.\\nThe Congress, even in Republican hands, has passed recent trade deals by the narrowest of margins.\\nNow, with Democrats in charge, Democratic trade consultant and former US Agriculture Department trade adviser Paul Drazek sees little hope for renewing the President\\'s power to make trade deals, expiring next July.\\n\"I think the changes of his getting that approval are pretty remote now. I mean, why would the Democrats in the House want to give the President a victory on a trade issue ... effectively, 18 months before the next election,\" Mr Drazek said.\\n\\nGrain harvesters hit out at farmers\\' pay rates\\nGrain harvesters say some farmers are taking advantage of the drought conditions to reduce their pay.\\nThe Australian Grain Harvesters Association says some large corporate farms in Queensland have dropped their pay rates from $14 dollars an acre to $10 dollars.\\nPresident Peter Bradley says despite contractors being desperate for work, there is no justification for paying less because of poor quality crops.\\n\"The quality of the grain, whether it be good, bad or indifferent this year, is that there\\'s so little grain around that the price of the grain has risen to double what they were getting last year and sometimes triple nearly,\" he said.\\n\\nFederation won\\'t bend seed rules\\nThe Australian Seeds Federation says it is not willing to bend the rules to allow farmers to donate seed to other growers this year.\\nThe South Australian Farmers Federation says plant breeders rights that prevent certain seed varieties being traded or given away should be relaxed during the drought.\\nBut the seed federation\\'s Christopher Melham says any changes would stop seed companies investing in new varieties.\\n\\nFruit growers halve watering times\\nVictoria\\'s fruit growers are cutting their watering times by half to ensure water supplies will last the season.\\nExtreme water shortages, particularly in the Goulburn Valley, mean orchardists have had to find ways to stretch their irrigation water.\\nSenior horticultural adviser Henry Schneider says new watering techniques for stonefruit are proving successful.\\n\"Peaches respond very well to regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) it\\'s a matter of just irrigating those peaches as you would on the normal intervals, say once a week but cut the irrigation time in half,\" he said.\\n\\nApricot orchard records bumper harvest\\nAn apricot orchard in far western New South Wales has bounced back from having its lowest recorded yield last year to a bumper harvest this season.\\nThe Tandou company says it can not plant cotton near Menindee this year because water allocations are too low.\\nBut spokesman Vince Trotter says the big results in Tandou\\'s orchard will influence the company\\'s future.\\n\\nGlider collecting soil, climate change information\\nA glider is flying over southern New South Wales this week is collecting information for an international project to understand soil moisture and climate change.\\nThe European Space Agency is launching a satellite next year to measure soil moisture from space and Australian researchers are developing models to interpret the data.\\nThe data collected by the glider will make the models more accurate.\\nThe University of Melbourne\\'s Dr Jeff Walker says the aim is to provide farmers and government with better information.\\n\\nWool grower wants mulesing trial money redirected\\nWool growers are being urged to start breeding so-called bare-bum sheep now to stave off future controversy over surgical mulesing.\\nThe industry has vowed to phase out mulesing by 2010 to placate animal welfare groups.\\nDubbo grazier Don Mudford is already breeding sheep that do not need mulesing and believes the industry should be spending more money on marketing, instead of searching for mulesing alternatives.\\n\"Because the day will come whether it\\'s in three years or not, the day will come when they won\\'t be able to mules but to stop mulesing the whole flock will take a few years,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt urged to dump GST on school boarders\\' food\\nThere is a call today for the Federal Government to dump the GST on food for boarding school students to bring down costs for struggling country families.\\nGary Le Duff from the Association of Independent Schools in South Australia says rural families which send their children to boarding schools should be entitled to financial assistance.\\nHe says the current application of GST for schools is different to other institutions.\\n\"There is an anomaly where boarding food is actually charged GST but if you\\'re in a hostel or staying a hospital there\\'s no GST,\" he said.\\n\\nDrought takes toll on small native mammals\\nThe dry in central Australia has taken its toll on small native mammals in the West MacDonnell Ranges near Alice Springs.\\nAn annual survey has found no central rock rats and no desert or native mice.\\nGlen Edwards from Parks and Wildlife says while the results are the worst in more than a decade, he is hopeful the species will re-populate.\\n\\nTop South Korean chefs tour Australia\\nImagination and talent have paid off for five of South Korea\\'s top young chefs, who are touring Australia after winning a major culinary competition.\\nThe chefs won the trip at the Korean equivalent of the Iron Chef competition, Meat and Livestock Australia\\'s Black Box Culinary Challenge.\\nFourteen teams had an hour to produce a four course meal from ingredients including Australian beef and lamb.\\nInterpreter Jinny Kim says the competition is fierce.\\n\\nWool growers seek Wool Poll audit\\nA group of wool growers has lodged a complaint against Australian Wool Innovation (AWI), accusing it of failing to conduct this year\\'s Wool Poll transparently.\\nThe five growers from WA and New South Wales, want to know why 50,000 voting packs were sent out, when there are only 30,000 eligible voters.\\nThe growers have called on the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to make sure AWI employees do not count or tabulate the votes and are seeking an immediate post-vote audit.\\nSignatory Shane Edwards who was an unsuccessful candidate for the AWI board in 2005, says he has real concerns\\n\"There\\'s a number of people that have contacted me and opinion around [is] that we\\'re not too sure whether that satisfies true and democratic process,\" he said.\\n\"So we feel it\\'s important to keep asking these questions because the question is this, what has AWI got to hide by denying this democratic process?\"\\nBut AWI says this group of growers continues to try to destabilise the Wool Poll, which it says is transparent in every way.\\n\\nJapan worried about milk supply during drought\\nResearch and development organisation Dairy Australia says milk may have to be redirected from new overseas markets to maintain supplies to Japan.\\nManaging director Mike Ginnivan has just returned from the country, where he met buyers worried about the drought\\'s impact on the supply of Australian milk.\\nJapan receives 20 per cent of Australia\\'s dairy exports and is seen as one of our strongest buyers.\\nMr Ginnivan says other Asian markets may have to be sacrificed.\\n\"China is a very difficult market - it\\'s a short term market,\" he said.\\n\\nFishing industry disappointed by orange roughy decision\\nTasmania\\'s fishing industry is disappointed by a decision to list the orange roughy as endangered.\\nIt is the first commercially caught species to be listed.\\nThe fishing industry had been preparing for their catch quotas to be slashed to allow stock levels to recover but were not expecting a complete ban.\\nNeil Stump from the Tasmanian Fishing Industry Council says the decision makes the future of the fishery uncertain.\\n\"I only heard about it yesterday so I haven\\'t had the opportunity to evaluate the potential ramifications but I think it\\'s the unknown, what does this actually mean for us?\" he said.\\nThe Federal Government has moved to establish a national standard for biodiesel.\\nEnvironment Minister Ian Campbell plans to have a quality standard for blended fuels within months.\\nJohn Keniry from the Australian Biodiesel Group says the standard is needed to give consumers confidence that biodiesel will not damage engines.\\nBut he says more government incentives are needed as well.\\n\"In the US for example, there\\'s a blender\\'s credit and in Europe, in effect, a lot of the countries mandating that diesel [say it] has to contain a certain amount of biodiesel,\" he said.\\n\\nWool market closes the week lower\\nAfter its recent strong run, the wool market has suffered a slight correction, finishing the week almost 2.5 per cent lower.\\nThe eastern market indicator fell 19 cents to 825 cents a kilogram.\\nAnalysts say the fall suggests that prices have risen too fast in recent weeks as buyers become nervous about future wool supplies due to the drought.\\nThere was still strong competition from Italian and Chinese buyers at the Newcastle sales, especially for broader microns.\\nBut Craig Brennan from Elders says it could be tougher next week, with many producers trying to make the most of the higher prices.\\n\"Due to the large rise last week the Sydney sale has blown out, originally it was 28,000, it\\'s now increased to 32,000 bales for the week so obviously growers that withheld stock have flooded the market,\" he said.\\n\"I\\'d be very surprised if the market held its ground next week with such a considerable offering.\\n\\nLivestock prices lower in WA\\nA new report in Western Australia has shown significant differences in livestock prices between the eastern states and the west.\\nThe Department of Agriculture report says saleyard prices for all stock classes except porkers are well below those on the eastern seaboard.\\nTrade steer prices were 14 per cent lower and export lambs 16 per cent lower between March 2003 and September this year.\\nTim D\\'arcy from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association says it is a dramatic difference.\\n\"It probably averages 50 cents a kilo year in and year out, but it varies anywhere between about 20 or 30 cents up to $1.28 a kilo and we\\'re always that far behind,\" he said.\\n\\nGreens hit out at Senate inquiry rejection\\nThe Greens are angry at the rejection of a proposed Senate inquiry into the future impact of climate change on rural communities.\\nThe party lodged a motion in the Senate calling for an investigation into what research is being done to manage lower rainfall on farms.\\nThe motion was defeated 33 votes to 31.\\nGreens Senator Rachel Siewert says CSIRO and ABARE have told the Senate that no Federal Government agencies are working on a comprehensive strategy.\\n\\nNSW to increase renewable energy targets\\nMore wind farms are expected to be built in New South Wales after the State Government\\'s decision to increase targets for renewable energy.\\nTen per cent of all energy will need to be from renewable sources by 2010 and up to 15 per cent by 2020.\\nAlready a new $220 million wind farm has been announced for Tarago in the state\\'s south, while another development is tipped for Woodlawn, near Goulburn.\\nState Planning Minister Frank Sartor says more projects will follow.\\n\"There\\'s going to be opportunities for wind farms, for solar, biogas, a bit more hydro in some niche schemes in the state,\" he said.\\n\\nMeat processor offers cash incentives to find new workers\\nSouth Australian-based meat processor T&R Pastoral is offering cash incentives to try to attract new abattoir workers.\\nThe company is looking for 80 employees interstate to work in plants at Murray Bridge and Lobethal.\\nSpokesman Brian Deavey says both meatworks are operating at full capacity as farmers destock and the additional labour is urgently needed.\\n\"We actually are assisting with relocation costs and housing for people right around Australia to come to Murray Bridge and to Lobethal, our two South Australian plants to work,\" he said.\\n\\nGrown in Australia label a step closer\\nThe food processing industry is closer to developing a new label to clearly show whether food has been grown in Australia.\\nProducers and some processors are concerned that current labels are misleading when it comes to how much Australian product is included.\\nThe Federal Government has set up a working group to examine the issue and member David Gartrell says they have developed a workable proposal.\\n\"What the working group endorsed at the moment is implementing a grown in Australia logo that would extend original brand options for packaged food products beyond the existing made in product of,\" he said.\\n\\nSchool children encouraged to grow 1m red poppies\\nA South Australian farmer is trying to encourage school children to grow a million red poppies to replace the plastic flowers we buy to mark Remembrance Day on November 11.\\nThe poppies symbolise the French battlefields where thousands of young Australians lost their lives during World War I.\\nNic Kentish from Mount Gambier has developed pre-packaged kits with seeds, pots and instructions, to encourage students to grow the real thing to raise funds.\\n\\nGovt unable to contain sugar cane smut disease\\nThe Queensland Government has conceded that it is unable to contain the devastating disease, sugar cane smut.\\nIt was confirmed late yesterday that smut has reached the Mackay area after it was first found near Bundaberg in June.\\nThe industry has now turned its focus to limiting the economic impact on the billion dollar sector.\\nEion Wallace, from the industry\\'s research and development arm, BSES, says smut may have been in Mackay for some time.\\n\"The evidence at the moment would suggest that it\\'s an incursion that occurred certainly before harvest and probably before this season, probably,\" he said.\\n\"Which means that it is not a failure of containment from Bundaberg and Childers but a separate incursion either at the same time as Bundaberg and Childers, or subsequent to it.\"\\nSouth of the border, the sugar industry has launched a new round of crop surveillance.\\nRick Beattie, from the New South Wales Sugar Milling Co-operative, believes the disease may have been spreading for at least a year but not been detected.\\nHe is asking farmers to check crops, so the disease can be detected early if it is there.\\n\\nNT campaign aimed at controlling brumby numbers\\nAuthorities in the Northern Territory are developing an education campaign to try to control the number of wild horses on Aboriginal land.\\nIt is estimated that up to 90,000 brumbies live in the Territory, and Parks and Wildlife has concerns about the environmental damage they are causing.\\nSenior wildlife ranger, Kym Schwartzkopff, says the horses have been allowed to run free and breed up.\\n\"It is very hard to work with people out there that have got an affinity with an animal, so it\\'s a kind of tread lightly area,\" he said.\\n\\nPrecise food labelling \\'closer\\'\\nThe food processing industry is closer to developing a new label to clearly show whether or not food has been grown in Australia.\\nProducers and some processors are concerned that current labels are misleading when it comes to showing how much Australian product is included.\\nThe Federal Government has set up a working group to examine the issue, and member David Gartrell says they have developed a workable proposal.\\n\"What the working group endorsed at the moment is implementing a \\'grown in Australia\\'

giant Rio Tinto has developed a revolutionary method of producing pig iron for steel making that could slash greenhouse gas emissions.\\nKnown as HIsmelt, the new technology has taken 25 years and $1 billion to develop, and could replace high energy use blast furnaces around the world.\\nManaging director of the HIsmelt Corporation, Stephan Webber, says the process still requires iron ore and coal, but removes the need for massive coke ovens.\\n\\nGraincorp says lower harvest estimate 2 million tonnes\\nGrain handler, Graincorp, is sticking by its forecast harvest of two million to four million tonnes across eastern Australia, despite the worsening drought.\\nThe latest figures show 94 per cent of New South Wales is now affected by drought.\\nBut Graincorp\\'s central regional manager, Murray Wilkinson, says some areas are producing better yields than expected.\\n\"North Queensland and Moree are going to exceed those forecasts that we had in to make-up the numbers, and it looks as though Dubbo will as well,\" he said.\\n\"At this stage we\\'re up to one point two million tonnes in the system and I suppose the lower end of the forecast is looking promising at this stage.\"\\nOnly two per cent of New South Wales is now rated as having satisfactory conditions.\\n\\nSheep genome mapping nearly complete\\nScience is one step closer to providing farmers with a complete genetic map of the sheep.\\nThe \\'virtual sheep genome\\' project has mapped 98 per cent of the sheep\\'s genetic make-up.\\nThat is enough to fast track the identification of the crucial genes for wool and meat quality, and even parasite resistance.\\nDr Robert Forage, who is leading the joint Australian Wool Innovation/Meat and Livestock Australia project, says the sheep\\'s genetic jigsaw is still not quite complete.\\n\"It\\'s put together using bits and pieces of information not only from the sheep but also from the cow and from the human as well,\" he said.\\n\"So we don\\'t have all the information we need from the sheep.\\n\"We\\'ve put some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together but there are still holes in it - we think we know where everything fits but we don\\'t have the complete sequence yet.\"\\n\\nSugar cane farmers brace for smut impact\\nThe Queensland government is trying to assess the economic impact of sugar cane smut on the state\\'s sugar industry.\\nThe crop disease was found at Mackay last week, after first being detected near Bundaberg in June.\\nThe Government is moving away from trying to contain the disease.\\nThe Government has appointed an independent economist to head up a team to assess the impacts and identify measures to manage the problem, and facilitate economic recovery.\\nThe team will report by December 18.\\nA stakeholder meeting on Friday was told replanting with resistant varieties over the next five years will cost an estimated $800 million, with an additional burden of a 10 per cent reduction in yield.\\n\\nIR changes to hit rural workers: unions\\nUnions say new Federal Government plans to allow companies to stand down workers without pay when there is no work will particularly hit rural employees.\\nThe Australian Workers Union (AWU) says the plan to allow stand-downs during natural disasters like drought will leave rural workers without pay and unable to claim the dole at the worst possible time.\\nStand-downs are already common with many rural employers, such as abattoirs, but Roger Fletcher from Fletcher International Exports says it is best for companies to negotiate with workers.\\n\"It\\'s vitally important,\" he said.\\n\"There\\'s no point in someone in Canberra or Sydney trying to run our business in a different area.\\n\"This is important in a lot of things we do across Australia.\\n\\nQld Govt mulls water charge freeze\\nThe Queensland Government says it will consider calls for a freeze on water charges.\\nThe lobby groups Agforce and the Queensland Farmers Federation want charges waived for irrigation water that will not be delivered this year.\\nNatural Resources and Water Minister Craig Wallace says the Government is costing the proposal, but wants the Federal Government to contribute.\\n\"The Acting Premier has given an undertaking to consider the Commonwealth and Agforce to implement water charging rate relief for people who are in exceptional circumstances,\" he said.\\n\\nWater a hot topic in Vic election\\nVictorian farmers say water is their key voting issue in the run-up to the state election later this month.\\nTransport, the city-country divide and better roads are also among concerns, according to a poll of farmers at the Shepparton sheep sale, in the Goulburn Valley.\\n\"My main issue would be water and Lake Mokoan,\" said one farmer.\\n\"About the closure of that, it\\'s just not a good thing to happen, it\\'s going to affect communities around this area.\\n\"Whoever provides the most action on water will get the votes.\"\\n\"Spending less money in the cities and more on the country people, and the water issue - the poor Goulburn irrigators having to pay for water they can\\'t get,\" said another.\\n\"I\\'m disappointed in the Government\\'s attitude to farmers our roads and bridges are shocking,\" another farmer said.\\nAnother, from Tallygaroopna, said water was the biggest issue of the campaign, as did a farmer from Moama:\\n\\nWater cuts force farmers to make difficult choices\\nFarmers in south-west New South Wales growing grapevines and citrus trees are starting to consider which areas of their properties they will stop watering as a result of water allocation cuts.\\nCheryl Rix from Western Murray Irrigation says irrigators were bracing for another cut to their water entitlements, but no one expected a 32 per cent reduction.\\nShe says horticulturalists need to look at all the available information so they can make sound business decisions.\\n\"I\\'d certainly encourage growers to really think about talking to their buyers and wineries and working out what will be will be bought next year and chase down the financial counsellors and look at the exceptional circumstances,\" she said.\\n\"The Department of Primary Industries will be running some sessions starting next week to look at how we can manage water better on farm.\"\\nThe state\\'s Department of Primary Industries is sending an emergency response team to to help farmers in the Murray and Murrumbidgee regions who have had their water allocations cut.\\n\\nNSW irrigators say crops at risk after water cuts\\nIrrigators in southern New South Wales are reeling after unprecedented cuts to water allocations.\\nWater for both the environment and agriculture has been pared back.\\nInflows over the past five months have been the lowest on record and the NSW Government says town water must take priority.\\nHigh security and carry over water in the Murray has been cut by another 32 per cent.\\nWhile in the Murrumbidgee General security allocations have been cut by 5 per cent and high security users will see a 10 per cent reduction, Murrumbidgee Irrigation\\'s Brett Tucker says agricultural production will be decimated.\\n\\nShearers spin yarns at WA reunion\\nShearing teams from the 1960s have spent the weekend reliving tales, at the fourth WA Shearers\\' Reunion near Perth.\\nThe event

work back on the farm while you\\'re receiving your unemployment benefits and it\\'s a full time commitment you\\'ve made, 30 plus hours, you won\\'t have to keep your job seeking up, you don\\'t have to keep presenting a diary saying you\\'ve looked for so many jobs, gone to interviews and so on, and that really means you can concentrate on that farm work,\" Ms Stone said.\\n\\nMurray Irrigation slashes farm water supply\\nIrrigation water to hundreds of farms in southern New South Wales will be cut off next month as Murray Irrigation concentrates on maintaining supplies for stock and domestic use.\\nThe company says irrigation will be restricted to areas close to the main channels, with consideration for contracted crops, feedlots and dairy farms.\\nMurray Irrigation chairman Stuart Ellis says the restrictions are necessary to prevent the whole system running dry by Christmas.\\n\\nFarmers march on Vic Parliament\\nFarmers have rallied in Melbourne today to raise awareness of rural issues in the final week of the Victorian state election.\\nFarmers on horseback and on tractors have been part of a procession through the central business district to Parliament House.\\nGoulburn Valley farmer Col Grinter says he is marching over having to pay for irrigation water he will not receive this season.\\n\"If the Government is fair dinkum about helping us, well the first thing they can do is pay for any water that we\\'re not going to get, you know for a farmer to be lumbered with a $20,000 water bill for example and not get any production out of it it makes it pretty darn hard,\" Mr Grinter said.\\n\\nPut down malnourished stock: RSPCA\\nThe RSPCA is calling on sheep and cattle producers to put down any livestock which are falling down due to lack of feed or water.\\nThe call comes after a Western Australian livestock producer was fined $25,000 after being charged with six counts of animal cruelty.\\nThe RSPCA says it found some sheep dead in a paddock, while officers were forced to put down another six.\\nRSPCA prosecutor Robin Moore says all producers have a responsibility to livestock and the drought is not an excuse for mistreatment.\\n\\nFrosts may halve crop production\\nUnseasonal frosts in Queensland\\'s cropping region could halve production for some broadacre farmers.\\nBelow average temperatures on Friday brought frosts and even snow to some parts of the Granite Belt in the state\\'s south.\\nCrop specialist Paul McIntosh says while they\\'re still assessing the damage, it already appears significant.\\n\"There\\'s sorghum, grain sorghum, corn, forage sorghum and even the feed values like Dolichos lablab, and some of those softer crops they are absolutely black, and the Eastern Downs is definitely the big area that\\'s been hit,\" Mr McIntosh said.\\n\\nGrain audit under consideration\\nThe Federal Agriculture Minister says he will consider an annual national audit of grain stocks.\\nThe Grains Council has called for the audit to address uncertainty about the level of grain held in storage.\\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics is currently investigating this year\\'s dramatically drought-reduced stocks.\\nPeter McGauran says with ongoing uncertainty over how much grain will be available for export or domestic livestock feed this year, the Government is continuing to process 40 applications to import grain.\\n\\nChaff carts trialled in weed fight\\nGrain growers in Victoria are trying to find ways to tackle herbicide resistance, especially as the big dry drags on.\\nFarmers are trialling chaff carts, large enclosed trailers that are towed behind headers and collect screenings, and small seeds that would normally be left in the paddock.\\nBernard Noonan from the Wimmera Conservation Farmers Association says they have been used successfully in South Australia.\\n\\nHunt under way for Australia\\'s best young truckie\\nThe trucking industry has launched a national campaign to find Australia\\'s safest and most skilled young driver to try to change public perception about the sector.\\nThe winner will receive a $220,000 prime mover.\\nThe competition has never before been held in Australia but has been a big hit in more than 30 countries.\\nStuart St Clair from the Australian Trucking Association says the competition is an attempt to tackle any negative images of truck driving.\\n\"The whole purpose of this is to show to the general public and to the industry itself about the professionalism of the industry and the fact that we\\'re looking to attract young people into this business as drivers and other support people,\" Mr St Clair said.\\n\\nSA investigates wine partnership with Chile\\nThe Chilean Government is looking at a partnership with the wine industry in South Australia\\'s Barossa Valley.\\nChile\\'s Foreign Minister and Ambassador have made a flying visit to the region to talk about a joint effort to sell wine to Asia.\\nState MP Ivan Venning says although Chile is a major competitor, it is worth investigating.\\n\"I was initially quite cautious because why would you want to do a deal with an international competitor, as Chile is with us, in the world of wine but I think the Australian wine, particularly our Barossa wines and the Chilean wines do complement each other because they don\\'t have the premium reds like we have,\" Mr Venning said.\\n\\nFarmers may look to cooperatives for protection\\nAgricultural cooperatives could be about to make a comeback, according to new research.\\nAuthor Gary Lewis has been looking at farm cooperatives in Australia and says by allowing many to be corporatised, farmers have lost an important weapon.\\nHe says farmers need to look after their own interests when it comes to drought, water and politics, and forming new cooperatives is one way of doing that.\\n\\nCity folk urged to \\'sponsor a cow\\' to support dairy farmers\\nCitysiders are being encouraged to \"sponsor a cow\" to help a group of Victorian dairy farmers feed their livestock.\\nThe Stanhope and District Development Committee has come up with the plan to help the district survive the drought.\\nChairman Bob Holschier says the campaign will benefit the farmers but also help sponsors to learn about the farm sector.\\n\\n\\'Functional foods\\' may help prevent disease\\nThere is a growing trend in Europe to produce so-called \\'functional foods\\'.\\nThe foods are said to help prevent life threatening diseases or curb potential health problems like obesity, heart disease and high blood pressure.\\nVisiting food scientist Charles Daly, from University College Cork in Ireland, says there is also a trend to match individual human genetics to different food groups to improve health.\\n\"We have different genetic make-up and so that means that we can have different susceptibility to some of the diseases that we mentioned, and that means that by looking at the genetic make-up of sub populations we can target foods to those groups,\" Mr Daly said.\\n\\nWatchdog calls for accurate labelling of GM imports\\nAustralia\\'s consumer watchdog has called for any genetically modified (GM) imports to be labelled accurately.\\nChoice, formerly known as the Australian Consumers Association, has raised the concern amid speculation that a major grain handler is expecting a consignment of GM canola from Canada within the next month.\\nDomestic canola supplies are tight this season due to the drought.\\nChoice spokeswoman Claire Hughes says consumers will not know they are eating GM canola oil.\\n\"If we do start to see a large amount of genetically modified canola coming into Australia, if it\\'s going to be processed and used as oil, consumers wouldn\\'t necessarily know if a product they\\'re purchasing has been genetically modified or does contain genetically modified canola oil,\" she said.\\n\"Because our GM labelling laws don\\'t require a product that has been highly refined, those products don\\'t have to be labelled and canola oil is a good example of that.\"\\nFederal Minister for Agriculture Peter McGauran says he is aware of the imports, which are intended for use in oil for human consumption and meal for stockfeed.\\nHe says the consignment has been independently sampled and tested before loading to confirm that only GM lines approved by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator are allowed in.\\n\\nDoctors call for rural health community service obligation\\nThe Rural Doctors Association (RDA) claims the Federal Government is more concerned with ensuring people have a phone rather than a doctor or hospital.\\nIt is calling for a community service obligation for rural health, much like the one which forces Telstra to provide services.\\nNew president Dr Peter Rischbieth from Murray Bridge in South Australia says millions of taxpayers\\' dollars pour out of rural communities to subsidise metropolitan health services.\\n\"They have the ethos that everyone should have a telephone and access to telephone repairs,\" he said.\\n\"[The] Rural Doctors Association believes they should have access to timely medical services.\\n\\nSugar cane smut found on third cane farm\\nA third Mackay cane farm has been found to have sugar cane smut, confirming fears that the fungal disease is widespread.\\nThe disease has been found on a property, 20 kilometres from the original find near Mackay, which had been discovered on Melbourne Cup day.\\nMackay Area Productivity Service spokesman Alan Royal says smut now looks to be well-established in central Queensland.\\n\"It\\'s very, very sad but it\\'s right across the other side of town and the whips were reasonably advanced but they\\'re certainly not big whips like we\\'ve been seeing,\" he said.\\n\"What did frighten me was on the weekend in one row at the initial farm, you know we were seeing whips that were four, five feet long, so it\\'s got a hold there but let\\'s hope we can get on top of it.\"\\nMeanwhile sugar cane farmers in Western Australia\\'s Ord Valley are looking for new varieties, because some which were once resistant to cane smut are not any more.\\nThe disease was first found in WA\\'s north-west in 1998.\\nCJ Ord River Sugar spokesman Wayne Paul says 100 varieties have been tried in the past five years but only a handful have shown promise.\\nHe says smut is also expected to reduce next year\\'s crop.\\n\"Q95 is probably the worst. It\\'s getting a bit of smut now whereas it didn\\'t have earlier on, so that will probably be mostly ploughed out over the next couple of years,\" he said.\\n\\nVegie growers told to change\\nTasmania\\'s vegetable growers have been told to change or be prepared to go out of business.\\nA strategic plan has been released for the sector, raising a number of areas to be addressed, like improved marketing and better relationships with food processors.\\nConsultant Euan Laird, who helped produce the report, says the changes will see some growers leave the industry.\\n\"Only the strong will survive,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s a really tough market out there and those that change and adapt, and modify, and meet the demands of consumers will survive so I\\'ll put an estimate that only 50 to 60 per cent of existing growers will survive in the long term and they are going to be those that are adaptable.\"\\nTasmania\\'s growers agree with the plan but most feel the hard work is still ahead.\\n\"We\\'ve got to start somewhere to get the vegetable industry off the ground or to stop it going back into the ground I suppose,\" one grower said.\\n\\nNSW Govt urged to allow graziers access to forests, national parks\\nThe New South Wales Farmers Association wants graziers to be given access to state forests and national parks to help feed hungry livestock.\\nThe association says feed is become scarce as the drought intensifies.\\nPresident Jock Laurie is urging the NSW Government to consider the proposal, which he says would help farmers hold onto core breeding stock.\\n\"As far as we\\'re concerned it would be a good tool for the feeding of core breeding stock throughout this drought period, especially when feed reserves are so low,\" he said.\\n\"You don\\'t need a long bureaucratic process to go through here, so get in and make a decision so that people can then plan well into the next few months about how they\\'re going to feed stock.\"\\n\\nStarlings attack cherry orchards\\nCherry orchards in central New South Wales are suffering major bird damage this year.\\nLarge numbers of starlings are attacking crops much earlier than normal, which growers believe is due to the drought and a lack of food.\\nCherry grower Guy Gaeta says he has never seen so much damage.\\n\"They are getting to the cherries when they are still green,\" he said.\\n\"Whether it is because they are hungry because of the drought.\\n\"I have never seem them before and everybody in the district is having the same problems. They are not eating the cherries, they are just chopping them off.\\n\"They go to taste them and then they are sour. They pull it off the tree and then they go to another one hoping it is a bit sweeter.\\n\\nCompany offers incentives to encourage truckies to stay\\nA major trucking company is planning to pay incentives to its drivers to encourage them to stay in the industry.\\nRoad Trains of Australia says it is hard to find staff with many drivers being lured into the mining sector.\\nWhile a national campaign is under way to attract more young people towards a career in transport, Mike Bailey from Road Trains\\' Mount Isa branch, says the company needs to make an effort to ease the skills shortage.\\n\"We\\'re trying to start a scheme where - just within ourselves - that they get rewarded if they stay in the industry, in our employment, for a number of years,\" he said.\\n\"At the end of that time they\\'ll get a bonus or whatever for hanging in there, it\\'ll be like a miniature long service leave sort of thing.\"\\n\\nIncreased pay helps retain mango pickers\\nImproved wages have helped to secure pickers for the Northern Territory\\'s mango season.\\nThe NT Mango Association has set a recommended minimum wage of $16.50 this year, more than a dollar above the national award.\\nPresident Peter Marks says there are not many pickers around but the incentive has helped to keep workers on for the whole season.\\n\"We had the unions involved, we had Aboriginal organisations involved and all the labour providers,\" he said.\\n\"We asked their opinion how we should manage this situation because we could see it was not going to be good.\\n\\nDrought set to bring live export trade growth\\nThe Australian live export trade is tipped to grow because of the drought.\\nLower prices for sheep and cattle have prompted international markets to step up demand for livestock which fell away after the Cormo Express incident in 2003 and more expensive livestock costs.\\nMeat and Livestock Australia spokesman Mike Hayward says despite low prices the trade does give producers another alternative during the dry times.\\n\"It was really noticeable in the west when they really got hit with the drought early in the year,\" he said.\\n\"A lot of livestock would have probably died on properties if they hadn\\'t had the live trade.\\n\\nWool bale fetches seasonal record price\\nA super ultra-fine bale of has fetched a seasonal record of 70,000 cents a kilogram in Victoria.\\nThe 12.4 micron bale is the finest yet produced by Brockville growers Andrew and Annie Gardner, who have a farm at Penshurst, in the western district.\\nThe same buyer also paid 67,000 cents a kilogram for a 12.5 micron bale from Pyrenees Park in central Victoria.\\n\\nEC farmer assistance requires rethink, expert says\\nAn environmental and climatic change risk analyst says the Federal Government needs to rethink its exceptional circumstances (EC) assistance to farmers.\\nThe University of Canberra\\'s Dr Brian Button says he is opposed to EC funding because floods and droughts are a natural occurrence and not exceptional.\\nHe says the Government should look at other ways of helping.\\n\"Now in Canada the Federal Government sponsors to the tune of about $2 billion Canadian a year a crop insurance scheme,\" he said.\\n\\nNew tree plantings fail to secure farm biodiversity: research\\nNew research says offsetting the clearing of native vegetation with new tree plantings is not an effective way to maintain biodiversity on farms.\\nThe Australian National University research suggests it takes up to 300 years for newly-planted vegetation to provide the same food and shelter to animals and birds.\\nEcology Professor David Lindenmayer says the findings show a need to preserve remnant vegetation.\\n\"We\\'ve found this from our data on the south-west slopes of New South Wales and it\\'s for reptiles, it\\'s for possums and gilders, arboreal marsupials and also for birds,\" he said.\\n\\nScientists claim new water filter halves purification costs\\nScientists in Italy say they have developed new ways of filtering water that should halve the cost of purification.\\nThe water membrane technology is already being used in other countries to recycle waste, make bore water palatable and desalinate salty water.\\nProfessor Enrico Drioli from the University of Calabria says the membranes, which look like plastic wrap, mirror the natural filtering membranes in our bodies.\\n\"Just a film that the one you can use for packaging your sandwich sometimes, so this film is able to be selective,\" he said.\\n\\nAWB\\'s profit drops\\nWheat exporter AWB has announced a 68 per cent cent fall in annual net profit to $58.1million.\\nThe company says it will pay a reduced final dividend of 4 cents, with the drought cutting the harvest and less domestic grain trading.\\nThe oil-for-food inquiry has cost the company almost $24 million, while redundancies and restructuring has taken $10 million off the bottom line.\\nManaging director Gordon Davis says AWB will remain viable if it loses control of the single desk for wheat exports in the wake of the Cole inquiry.\\n\"AWB has been pursuing a strategy of diversifying its income away from pool management. We\\'ve got strong and growing business in our international trading in Geneva, Brazil and India,\" Mr Davis said.\\n\\nGrain growers won\\'t oppose removal of AWB\\'s wheat veto\\nThe Grains Council says it would not oppose any move by the Federal Government to remove AWB\\'s veto on wheat export applications.\\nThere is a push from within the Government to take away the veto to allow other grain companies to export wheat.\\nBut chairman of the peak body, Murray Jones, says growers must be consulted before any major structural changes are made to the single desk.\\n\"We don\\'t know what the Government\\'s reaction will be and I\\'m leaving it open to them to make their reaction,\" Mr Jones said.\\n\"We\\'ve consulted regularly and continuously during the course of the last few months and we\\'ll continue to do so, and continue to put forward the growers\\' position, which is they wish to retain a single desk and they want to be consulted if there are to be any changes.\"\\nThe Grains Council says it wants growers to have control of the export system.\\nBut the Australian Grain Exporters Association is pushing the Federal Government to remove the single desk.\\nThe association of bulk grain handlers wants an interim licensing system put in place to smooth the way for deregulation.\\n\\nBeazley tours NSW drought affected areas\\nFederal Labor leader Kim Beazley has begun a tour of central New South Wales to hear first hand how the drought is hurting rural families.\\nMr Beazley has used the trip to make his first announcement on drought policy,\\nHe visited three properties near Forbes in the central west of New South Wales and will be shown the Jemmalong Irrigation Scheme, which this year has a zero water allocation.\\nYoung farmers highlighted the difficulties they are encountering in remaining viable and told Mr Beazley about their failed crops, many of which were to be irrigated.\\nThe Labor leader told the producers if his party were elected, it would set up a series of research institutes to help commercialise technology to better manage the drought.\\n\\nLive export trade inhumane, says RSPCA\\nThe RSCPA says it has proof that a majority of Australians believe the live export trade is inhumane.\\nAn national phone survey of 600 people by Roy Morgan Research has found almost 60 per cent believe the trade is cruel.\\n\\nMLA holds Adelaide AGM\\nThe livestock industry\\'s peak national body, Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), is holding its annual general meeting in Adelaide today.\\nAround 250 producers and industry representatives have finished the producers forum which covered the current and future direction of the red meat industry.\\nMany apologies were received from farmers, both local and interstate, who have been affected by bushfires and could not attend.\\nFour resolutions will be voted on at the AGM regarding the election of MLA directors, followed by a question period where the recent NLIS poll scandal and the process of registering voters from levy paying producers is expected to be raised.\\nAt the same time, more than 150 cattle producers have rallied on the Western Downs in Queensland, in a direct boycott of the MLA meeting.\\nThe Australian Beef Association (ABA) says it is protesting against laws and regulations that destroy the viability of producers.\\nThe rally has seen producers travel from as far as Western Australia to attend the Queensland rally and chairwoman Linda Hewitt says she is going to call on the Australian Government to undertake a full review of Meat and Livestock Australia.\\nThe rally has already seen a group of graziers hear from experts on depression and a psychiatrist who is highlighting the need for help at the farm gate.\\nSpeaker Danny Beer from the US cattle producing organisation R-Calf has spoken about its support for country of origin labelling in the United States.\\n\\nUncontracted winegrape growers may be in demand\\nUncontracted winegrape growers might have more luck selling their fruit this year.\\nA lack of water and frost damage in some parts of Australia means that remaining grapes are likely to be in demand.\\nMike Stone from Murray Valley Winegrowers in Victoria says preliminary figures show the coming harvest could be several hundred thousand tonnes down on last season.\\n\"Already we have heard of some offers for cabernet sauvignon and merlot of around $400 a tonne, so there is evidence of more interest,\" he said.\\n\\nBiofuels industry facing grain cost challenge\\nA new report says the biggest challenge for the fledgling biofuels industry is to keep down the cost of grain for alternative energy production.\\nThe independent report predicts Australia will almost double its production target of 350 million litres of biofuel by 2010.\\nBut report author Graeme Bethune says cost is the biggest problem and eventually grain which is currently exported may be in demand by manufacturers.\\n\\nNuclear power report won\\'t help uranium industry in short term\\nAustralia\\'s uranium sector says yesterday\\'s positive review into nuclear power will make little difference to the industry in the short term.\\nAlthough share prices in uranium explorers rose on the back of the Switkowski report, the Association of Mining and Exploration says Australia\\'s uranium reserves are still under-utilised.\\nSpokesman Ian Loftus says the public tends to confuse nuclear energy with uranium mining.\\n\"We have some of the world\\'s great resources in terms of uranium in the ground and we have the ability here and now, subject to government approvals of course, to dig up that uranium and use it to provide fuel for clean electricity for other parts of the world,\" Mr Loftus said.\\n\\nMcGauran supports environmental stewardship concept\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has told a national conference on land management that the Government supports the idea of paying farmers for environmental work.\\nMr McGauran has backed the environmental stewardship concept at the first national gathering of Australia\\'s 56 natural resource management groups on the Gold Coast.\\nAndrew Drysdale from the Queensland Regional Groups Collective says the payment scheme is welcome but might not come into effect until 2008.\\n\"The noise that [is] coming out of Canberra, it\\'s not only about funding but how the funding is going to occur,\" he said.\\n\"They\\'re starting to talk about stewardship payments now which breaches that problem of being tied to election cycles.\\n\\nRising humidity, heat aids croc growth\\nThe rapidly rising humidity and heat in the Northern Territory is proving good news for crocodile farms.\\nMany are busy grading baby saltwater crocodiles, according to size.\\nAt Noonamah on the outskirts of Darwin, Mick Burns is sorting 12,000 baby reptiles, which are more than one-metre long.\\n\"The animals get very dominant and territorial and they\\'ll blue with any smaller animal,\" he said.\\n\"No losses of fingers but certainly there would be a few little nips.\\n\"This year has been pretty slow because we have had such a cold dry season, it\\'s the third or fourth largest number of days that have been below a certain temperature so that certainly slows down the animals.\\n\\nStudent conference aims to share environment knowledge\\nWith debate about the future of drought-stressed rivers in the headlines, Canberra students have launched plans for an International Conference on River Health.\\nThe conference, set for October next year, will bring more than 600 students from across Australia and around the world to Canberra to share knowledge about their environment.\\nFounder and convener Arron Wood says it is important to let our future leaders explore river issues now, so they have a head start.\\n\"To have kids from small towns like Mildura and Renmark, and those sorts of things, talking to someone in the Amazon about the issues that they\\'re facing,\" he said.\\n\\nCities urged to consider buying water from irrigators\\nA report commissioned by the Federal Government says cities will need to consider buying water from irrigators to address major urban shortages.\\nReport author John Marsden says buying water from irrigators is a possibility for Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Canberra.\\nHe says communities must consider the option.\\n\"In general there\\'s been a reluctance by governments to put this issue firmly on the table because of fear of upsetting rural electorates,\" he said.\\n\"But of course, the rural waterholders trade water all the time, between themselves and there\\'s no reason why the trade can\\'t be with other parties, including with the cities.\"\\nMeanwhile the National Water Commission has confirmed it is conducting a feasibility study into piping water from so-called \"water rich\" areas of northern New South Wales, to drought-affected south-east Queensland.\\nThe study, which will go to the Federal Government, is looking at rivers including the Wilson, Brunswick, Richmond, Tweed and Clarence.\\nAlthough the region has high rainfall, Wayne Franklin from Rous Water says there is not enough water to pipe across the border.\\n\"When you look at the Clarence and the Clarence is the one below us so we\\'re centred on the Richmond Valley,\" he said.\\n\"If you look at either of our valleys and the amount of water we have we\\'re really small fry compared to Queensland.\\n\\nABARE chief to take on climate change role\\nThe nation\\'s new chief commodity forecaster says predicting the effect of climate change on agriculture will have to become part of his work.\\nPhillip Glyde has been appointed executive director of the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) after working in the Departments of Prime Minister, Industry and Agriculture.\\nHe says the agency needs to be responsive to industry and farmer needs but says providing economic analysis on climate change will be difficult.\\n\"I think it is something that we will be doing more on, I hesitate to say when,\" he said.\\n\"Really the issue there is the quality of the science and really the economic analysis flows from the science.\\n\"One of the problems we\\'ve got at the moment is that impacts of climate change at a regional level or on a particular industry aren\\'t really that well known.\"\\nMeanwhile grain farmers are being urged to factor in climate change when planning for the future.\\nDr Peter Hayman from the South Australian Research and Development Institute has won a \\'Seed of Light\\' award from the Grains Research and Development Corporation for his efforts to make farmers aware of climate change.\\nHe says many grain growers are now wondering how to adapt.\\n\"Certainly, no longer are people saying - what is climate change, is this something my grandchildren have to worry about?\" he said.\\n\"They\\'re concerned about it and wanting to know more information about it now and what it means for their decision-making and planning.\\n\\nWater use for timber plantations to be managed\\nTasmania is moving to manage water use by the timber plantation sector as part of a review of its Water Management Act.\\nThe review is recommending a study of water rights security and tenure, changes to the dams approval process and a risk management strategy for water use by large scale land use changes.\\nAlan Harradine from the Department of Primary Industries and Water says catchment models need to be refined.\\n\"Under the National Water Initiative we basically are required to put in place those options,\" he said.\\n\\nCattle producers urged to audit livestock records\\nThe Australian Beef Association (ABA) wants cattle producers to audit their livestock records listed on the database of the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS).\\nThe system, which is designed to track every animal through electronic ear tags in case of a disease outbreak, has been heavily criticised by the breakaway group.\\nNew president Brad Bellinger from New South Wales says the ABA\\'s own research shows only 30 per cent of NLIS producer records are accurate.\\n\"Now their own audit is the matter of matching what their actual property sales are to what is actually registered on the NLIS database account,\" Mr Bellinger said.\\n\"We want to point out to the regulators and the Minister how bad the situation, how inaccurate the NLIS system is.\"\\nThe Federal Government has commissioned an official audit of the database.\\nMeanwhile the peak national body, Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), is calling for unity within the cattle industry.\\nThe ABA boycotted MLA\\'s annual general meeting in Adelaide yesterday and staged a rally in Queensland.\\nMLA chairman Don Heatley says cattle producers need to resolve NLIS issues by working together.\\n\"Yes, there is criticism, and I don\\'t resile from the criticism,\" he said.\\n\"At the end of the day we\\'ve developed a new system and NLIS is new and it\\'s not perfect at this stage but we will continue to work on it.\\n\\nPig tracing may go high-tech\\nThe pig industry is considering launching an electronic system to trace animals.\\nThe industry has already set up a traceability system called Pig Pass, where producers who export pigs fill out national vendor declaration forms.\\nBut Bill Salter from producer group Australian Pork Limited (APL) says they are now looking at a paperless system with swipe cards instead of individual animal tags.\\n\"The system would work on the basis of having everyone involved in Pig Pass actually being registered on the APL database,\" Mr Salter said.\\n\\nBiodiesel plant opens\\nA $48 million biodiesel plant has been officially opened in Darwin today.\\nIt is initially expected to annually produce 150 million litres of biodiesel using imported palm oil.\\nNatural Fuels managing director Dick Selwood says work is under way to develop a Territory soya bean industry to supplement the feedstock.\\n\\nNative flower exports wilt\\nAustralia\\'s native flower sector expects to lose about 30 per cent of its export flower crop this year.\\nDrought, frosts and hot weather have decimated crops, with some growers reporting bud losses of 50 per cent and hundreds of thousands of flowers which are unsaleable.\\nTony Kosky from the Australian Flower Export Council says lower production levels will affect Australia\\'s international reputation as a reliable flower supplier.\\n\\nBeazley commits to examining replanting scheme\\nThe federal Opposition Leader has committed his party to examining a replanting scheme for farmers in drought affected areas.\\nKim Beazley has been in central western New South Wales to look at the impact of the drought.\\nHe says it is obvious people are hurting and assisting farmers to plant crops when conditions improve is one way of helping.\\n\"In the short term I\\'ll need to take back and talk through with my colleagues the things that need to happen with regard to the various drought programs, state and federal,\" he said.\\n\\nCane toads help reduce mosquito numbers\\nIf you dread summer because of the mosquitoes, you might need to start hanging around cane toads.\\nAs part of a study into the effect toads are having on native fauna, a team of scientists has found cane toad tadpoles are reducing mosquito numbers.\\nProfessor of ecological biology at the University of Sydney Rick Shine says the toads could be contributing to better human health.\\n\"We\\'ve simply set out bowls of water with and without cane toad tadpoles, we\\'ve put mosquito larvae in there and we\\'ve seen whether or not the mosquito larvae do survive and what size mozzie actually flies out at the end,\" Prof Shine said.\\n\\nProspect for rain improves\\nThe National Climate Centre says a duel between sea temperatures in the Pacific and Indian oceans could bring slightly higher rainfall to much of Australia.\\nIndian Ocean temperatures are rising off Western Australia and up to Indonesia, cancelling out a worsening El Nino effect in the Pacific Ocean.\\nThere is now a 50 per cent chance of average rainfall across most of Australia in the next three months, although north Queensland could be drier.\\nSenior climatologist Lyn Bettio says the prospect of rain certainly has not got any worse.\\n\"It\\'s actually looking better than what it was last month,\" she said.\\n\\nMerino prices plummet\\nPrices for top merino sheep have plummeted at the annual Yass circuit sale, in New South Wales, once a stronghold for fine and superfine wool.\\nWith a larger offering than last year, merino sheep and cross bred lambs are being offloaded as the drought bites deeper, with ewes being passed in for $1.50 each.\\nThe average price for Roseville ewes of the Merryville line was $10, down from a height of $70 in previous years.\\nRichard Buckmaster says the low prices will hurt farmers.\\n\"It\\'s very disappointing. I know we\\'ve got bad seasons and everything but I think this is the worst we\\'ve had in 17 years of circuit sales,\" Mr Buckmaster said.\\nIn general, the wool market has eased this week, falling 2 per cent at sales in Sydney, Fremantle and Melbourne.\\nThe eastern market indicator (EMI) fell 18 cents, to finish the week at 826 cents a kilogram.\\n\\nStronger quarantine conditions for imported prawns recommended\\nBiosecurity Australia has recommended tougher quarantine restrictions on prawn imports, which could effectively end the trade.\\nThe domestic industry has called for an end to imports due to disease concerns, although importers oppose any tougher restrictions.\\nFederal Fisheries Minister Eric Abetz says if the draft recommendations are adopted, most of the countries which currently send prawns to Australia will not be able to prove they are free of disease.\\n\\nACCC clamps down on misleading labels\\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is clamping down on misleading claims being made about food and drink.\\nIt has published new guidelines on what can be labelled organic, free range, natural and fresh.\\nCommissioner John Martin says producers and processors of everything from eggs to fruit juice are increasingly flouting the law but will not be able to get away with it for long.\\n\\nLegislation blocks grasslands clearing\\nAfter three years of wrangling, Tasmania has passed legislation to protect remnant grasslands from land clearing.\\nThe controversial legislation was only passed yesterday in Tasmania\\'s Upper House after a number of modifications were made to the Bill.\\nTasmania was obliged under a federal agreement signed in 2003 to protect non-forest native vegetation.\\nPresident of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, Roger Swain, says the legislation is restrictive but at least provides certainty.\\n\\nGovt contributes to WA carbon trial\\nThe Federal Government will contribute $60 million towards the world\\'s biggest carbon capture and storage trial in Western Australia.\\nThe money will go to the Gorgon natural gas project off the Pilbara coast, which is still waiting for the final go ahead.\\nIf it proceeds, 125 million tonnes of excess carbon dioxide will be liquefied and buried 2.5 kilometres under the sea bed in saline aquifers .\\nEnvironment Minister Ian Campbell says it is imperative the project gets off the ground.\\n\"The Gorgon project, being the biggest one of its type anywhere in the world, in fact bigger than all of the other projects in the rest of the world put together, will help us demonstrate that it can be done safely, that you can put in place a regulatory environment around it, put the risk management techniques around it,\" Senator Campbell said.\\n\\nIrrigators discuss compensation with Premier\\nNew South Wales farmers have met with Premier Morris Iemma to ask for compensation for their cut water allocations.\\nThe Government has slashed carry over water allocations for Murray River irrigators by half.\\nWhat water is available will only be given to customers near the major supply channels to reduce evaporation.\\nChairman of Southern Riverina Irrigators Ted Hatty says the Government has not offered any immediate help.\\n\"The Premier has said that he will look at what he can do, he said we\\'re talking weeks not months, so I suppose that was a positive,\" he said.\\n\\nDairy Aust won\\'t ask farmers to increase service levy\\nDairy Australia says it will not ask farmers to support an increased service levy next

Canberra.\\nOnly premium wines that have won other awards can enter, with the main awards going to wines from Margaret River, the Hunter Valley and the Yarra Valley.\\nChairman of judges James Halliday says top drops are cheap because of the wine glut.\\n\"2004, 2005, 2006 which are the three vintages which have brought the oversupply issue right onto the front page, happened to have been three very good vintages,\" he said.\\n\"So if you\\'re going to have too much wine it\\'s rather a good thing to have too much good wine, or very good wine, rather than too much bad wine.\"\\nMeanwhile drought, frost damage and lower water allocations are drawing down Australia\\'s wine stock glut faster than anticipated.\\nThe wine industry has revised down its estimates for next season from 900-million litres to 460-million litres.\\nPredictions for another extreme drought season next year are expected to bring yields down by 20 per cent.\\nLawrie Stanford from the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation says the excess stocks are certainly dropping and that is good news.\\n\"The latest estimate that the industry has is that stocks above a desirable level would rate at something like 460 million litres,\" he said.\\n\\nFar north Qld fruit wines in demand\\nThe makers of tropical fruit wines in far north Queensland say they are struggling to keep up with demand.\\nThe wines are made from fruit including passionfruit, native tropical berries, bananas, lychees, rambutans and black sapotes.\\nTony Woodall from the Tropical North Queensland Wineries Association says the region has become the world\\'s leading commercial fruit wine producer.\\n\"Some of the fruits are quite bland like grapes and don\\'t make a particularly nice wine,\" he said.\\n\"Not saying grapes don\\'t, they do of course.\\n\\nCole inquiry report finalised\\nAfter nearly a year of public hearings, 7,500 pages of court transcript and more than 70 witnesses, the final report of the Cole inquiry is finished.\\nCommissioner Terence Cole is today handing the document to Australia\\'s Governor-General Michael Jeffery in a brief ceremony at Admiralty House, the official Sydney residence of the Governor-General,\\nIt will advise the Federal Government on the actions it should take against monopoly wheat exporter AWB and two other Australian companies for kickback payments they made to the Iraqi regime in breach of UN sanctions.\\nAWB was by far the largest contributor, paying more than $290 million.\\nHuge secrecy surrounds the contents of the report, which will be tabled in Federal Parliament next week.\\nIt is widely predicted Commissioner Cole will recommend the laying of criminal charges against some AWB executives.\\nThe report\\'s contents will also have a bearing on the future of the single desk.\\nMeanwhile the author of an AWB commissioned report into wheat exports says change to the single desk is inevitable.\\nBut the report says any changes should take place gradually, to minimise the impact on wheat growers.\\nFormer world trade commissioner and report author, Alan Oxley, has warned that any immediate changes could hurt 12,000 grain growers from marginal areas.\\n\"These tend to be farmers who are not in upper income groups who are solely dependent on grain in areas where there is variability,\" Mr Oxley said.\\n\"So as far as we are concerned they are concentrated in the eastern wheatbelt of Western Australia, and on the Eyre Peninsula (in SA), and in western NSW. They are the ones who tend to rely on the collective marketing of their crops.\"\\nBut independent grains analyst Malcolm Bartholomaeus disagrees.\\nHe says most farmers would take advantage of an open market.\\n\"I\\'m not sure that we hold back the entire industry for a smaller group who may have a little more trouble adjusting. Farmers aren\\'t silly, you change the rules and they rapidly adapt,\" Mr Bartholomaeus said.\\n\\nDry conditions to blame for slump in farmers\\' confidence\\nThe confidence of Australian farmers has slumped to its lowest level in six years.\\nThe state of mind in rural Australia been revealed in the latest Rabobank Rural Confidence Survey.\\nJust 15 per cent of farmers expect the rural economy to pick up over the coming 12 months compared with 19 per cent last quarter.\\nThe states hardest hit are Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia.\\nRabobank\\'s head of rural banking, Neil Dobbin, says ongoing dry conditions are largely to blame.\\n\"This is the lowest confidence farmers have had since the survey started, which is six years ago. Sixty-five per cent of the farmers thought that income would worsen over the next 12 months,\" Mr Dobbin said.\\n\\nTasmania struggling with drought\\nConditions continue to deteriorate in Tasmania after record low rainfall and river flows.\\nThe president of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, Roger Swain, says the State is experiencing one of its worst seasons in 100 years.\\nHe says while pockets of the State are having a reasonable year, the extended dry and heavy frosts are making the season tough.\\n\"It\\'s quite clearly a drought, you only have to look around and see,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'re looking at the ground now almost as if it is February here in Tasmania.\\nThe National party\\'s resurgence in country Victoria is continuing, with more votes counted in the state election.\\nLabor has conceded defeat in the Gippsland seat of Morwell with the seat going to Russell Northe from the Nationals, with the help of Liberal preferences.\\nThe Nationals also took the seat of Mildura from independent MP, Russell Savage, in a swing influenced by Labor\\'s proposal for a toxic waste dump in the electorate.\\nThe Nationals have increased their Lower House numbers by two to nine members in a poll where they feared they would be nearly wiped out by preference deals.\\n\\nGerman company buys wool directly through producers\\nOne of the world\\'s major wool spinners has started buying greasy wool directly from merino producers because of high levels of dark fibre contamination in wool being sold through Australian auction rooms.\\nGerman company Sudwolle processes 200,000 bales a year at mills in China, Germany and Poland - the equivalent of 10 per cent of the Australian wool clip.\\nIt has been trialing buying wool through an Adelaide firm, which sources bales from a small group of fine wool growers.\\nDirector of purchasing Gotz Giebel blames the high contamination rate on a trend by growers towards sheep which produce both meat and wool, which have more black fibres in their fleece.\\n\"We have initiated that because we noticed a lot of quality problems and due to our size and our market situation we thought we have to do something in the industry,\" he said.\\n\"Also to encourage growers and that\\'s very important.\\n\"We also want to reward the grower for better qualities.\"\\nBut wool brokers and buyers in South Australia believe local producers have grown one of the best clips of the past five seasons.\\nLandmark\\'s state wool manager Trevor James says the quality has held up despite the lack of rain.\\n\"Probably that early rain in March put a bit of feed on the ground and that early rain made a big difference, so we\\'ve got a lot of really good length, good sound wools, probably been the best we\\'ve seen for five years and we\\'ve had some really fantastic wools coming through,\" he said.\\n\\nLamb feedlot shed open for business\\nOne of eastern Australia\\'s biggest lamb feedlot sheds has opened.\\nBased in Goondiwindi, in southern Queensland, it will house more than 3,500 sheep undercover.\\nOwner Kerry Corish says they originally expected to sell around 15,000 fat lambs a year but that number has significantly increased due to the drought\\n\"I think at the moment the way it looks and the drought conditions, and because we\\'ve bought far more sheep than what we anticipated we would be able to buy, and that\\'s simply driven by the drought and because (of) the large numbers available down south and the price drop in sheep, that we probably will go 20,000 plus, I would imagine,\" Mrs Corish said.\\n\\nCattle prices down\\nDespite cattle supply numbers being lower in all states, weaker demand at southern markets in the last week had a downward effect on national indicator prices.\\n\\nDairy Australia elects new president\\nA dairy farmer from Bega in southern New South Wales has been appointed chairman of the peak industry body, Dairy Australia.\\nMax Roberts will replace Pat Rowley to lead the farmer-funded research and development organisation.\\nMr Roberts says $57 million in levy money was spent last year to help farmers survive the drought and fight for their rights.\\n\"Our leadership role is [to ensure] the farmers have good information and water again is another good example as the dairy industry is probably the biggest single user in agriculture of water,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve got to be able to defend our position and make sure our arguments are good and sound because there\\'s a lot of competition for that water.\"\\nFarmers will be asked to vote on three levy options early next year.\\nBecause of the drought, Dairy Australia is asking them to maintain the current levy rate rather than increase it.\\nMr Rowley represented dairy farmers at a state, national and international level for more than 30 years.\\nHe also helped create the peak body five years ago and says he is sorry to be leaving at such a testing time.\\n\"I\\'m sure the industry will no doubt get through this drought and it always rains at the end of a drought, but there will be some people who will struggle very hard and that is sad to me as I go, but it wouldn\\'t matter when I decided to go, there would be some challenge somewhere,\" Mr Rowley said.\\n\\nCourt closes chapter on native title claims\\nMembers of the Federal Court have donned heavy black robes in 40 degree heat to close a chapter on a series of long-running native title claims in north Western Australia.\\nAt a small community outside of Kununurra, the court granted native title to almost 7,000 square kilometres of the East Kimberley, bringing the total land under native title in the region to 35 per cent.\\nEdna O\\'Malley from the Miriuwung Gajerrong Corporation says the ruling not only allows access to country but will bring economic benefits in the future.\\n\"Like the judge said today, it was only a pen to the paper to end 12 years of hard struggle,\" she said.\\n\\nPolystyrene fish sculpture aims to raise environmental awareness\\nThe largest murray cod ever photographed is slowly being carved out of polystyrene by communities along the River Murray.\\nSouth Australian sculptor and geologist Indiana James has been encouraging people to help him replicate the huge cod, which was nearly two and a half metres long and weighed a whopping 180 kilograms.\\nHe is hoping to raise environmental awareness through his journey which began in 2002.\\n\"Everybody loves a big fish and a big fish story,\" he said.\\n\"I knew a lot of people would come and talk about the fish, and my real agenda is the health of the river and keeping an awareness of the health of the river in the public eye.\\n\\nBill aims to strip AWB of veto powers\\nTwo Liberal senators from Western Australia are planning to introduce a private member\\'s Bill to the Senate today calling for the removal of AWB\\'s veto over wheat exports.\\nSenators David Johnston and Judith Adams say change is needed whatever the outcome of the Cole inquiry report into AWB, set to be tabled in Federal Parliament this afternoon.\\nSenator Johnston says even if the Bill fails, the Federal Government should act to remove the wheat export veto immediately.\\n\"With about 70 per cent of wheat growers in Western Australia engaged in harvest, withholding their wheat from the statutory marketing single desk operator, I think it\\'s a crisis and I think it\\'s a crisis that needs to be addressed now,\" Senator Johnston said.\\nThe National party\\'s resurgence in country Victoria is continuing, with more votes counted in the state election.\\nLabor has conceded defeat in the Gippsland seat of Morwell with the seat going to Russell Northe from the Nationals, with the help of Liberal preferences.\\nThe Nationals also took the seat of Mildura from independent MP, Russell Savage, in a swing influenced by Labor\\'s proposal for a toxic waste dump in the electorate.\\nThe Nationals have increased their Lower House numbers by two to nine members in a poll where they feared they would be nearly wiped out by preference deals.\\n\\nGovt assesses wheat export system future\\nThe Federal Government has started considering the future of the wheat export system following the Cole inquiry report.\\nFederal Government ministers are satisfied they have survived the Cole inquiry unscathed.\\nBut now they are facing the difficult task of deciding whether the wheat export system rorted by AWB needs to be changed.\\nLiberals including Wilson Tuckey and Bill Heffernan want change.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran says his party wants to keep the single desk in some form, although he realises that is not the view of the whole Cabinet.\\nHowever he says AWB may yet be part of the solution.\\nUS Wheat Associates, the export marketing arm which represents American wheat growers, wants the single desk removed.\\nThe association\\'s president, Alan Tracey, says Australian farmers have been duped by AWB and the single desk is distorting world trade.\\nHe says the association will support moves by the powerful US Senate Agriculture Committee to conduct its own inquiry into AWB.\\n\"AWB has a subsidiary in the United States, the funds that came from the oil-for-food program moved through US banks,\" he said.\\n\"There are a lot of connections here and possible violations of US law.\\n\\nSouth Korea rejects US beef shipment\\nSouth Korea has rejected a US beef shipment over a tiny bone fragment, dealing a major blow to US efforts to recapture the market.\\nUS beef was first banned in Korea after mad cow disease was detected in Washington state in 2003.\\nUS Agriculture Department Deputy Under-Secretary Chuck Lambert is upset, not just that Korea will not accept any bone in US beef, which could transmit mad cow disease, but by the way it handled the initial post-mad cow US shipment.\\n\"It\\'s disappointing that they\\'ve gone to the lengths that they have to identify this small, very small piece of bone in more than nine tonnes of product,\" he said.\\nThe US has asked an international standard setting body to assign the US a mad cow-risk classification but insists US beef meets existing safety guidelines.\\n\\nQuarantine protocols imposed on NZ avocados\\nBiosecurity Australia has imposed new quarantine protocols on avocados imported from New Zealand.\\nThe disease avocado scab has been found in New Zealand and is not known to be in Australia.\\nThe new rules will require fruit to be sprayed before harvest and dipped in copper after harvest.\\nHugh Moore from NZ Avocado Growers says 90 per cent of the crop comes to Australia in a market worth $30 million and he is rejecting any suggestion that fruit imports should be banned.\\n\"The spraying mechanisms do work and that\\'s in their own science,\" he said.\\n\\nGrain handler posts record profit\\nSouth Australian-based grain handler ABB Grain Limited has post a record $66.7 million profit for 2005-2006.\\nThe results are up 60 per cent, largely due to expanded marketing, storage and handling operations.\\nBut there are concerns about the ongoing drought.\\nManaging director Michael Iwaniw says to cut costs, the company is reducing staff and operations, and suspending executive salary increases.\\n\"We\\'ve closed 40 receival sites, we have reduced our casual labour significantly and we are looking at transferring our permanent labour force across the states so we\\'ll utilise labour more efficiently, looking at reducing operating hours,\" he said.\\n\"You\\'d expect a fall in profits and we\\'ve alluded to that.\\n\\nVFF demands end to Goulburn-Murray water trading\\nThe Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF) wants the State Government to stop water being permanently traded between the Goulburn and Murray River systems.\\nCurrently irrigators on the Goulburn system only have access to a quarter of their annual water allocation, while Victorian irrigators on the Murray can use 95 per cent.\\nWhen a water allocation is traded from the Goulburn to the Murray, it is automatically increased from 23 to 95 per cent.\\nVFF water resources committee spokesman Richard Anderson says as a result, Murray irrigators are now worried their allocations are at risk.\\n\"Once it\\'s transferred down on to the Murray system, the person buying that megalitre of water actually gets to use 95 per cent, being the current allocation on the Murray system,\" he said.\\n\\nHay exporters meeting export demand\\nNorthern Territory hay producers are taking advantage of the drought across the rest of the country to meet export demand.\\nFive containers of hay are on their way to Korea and Japan.\\nThe Territory\\'s Agricultural Association spokesman, Mal Bishop, says transport costs have stopped them developing an interstate market but there is strong interest in their tropical varieties.\\n\"This year is a really good year to be pushing it because of the dry season down south and in the eastern states,\" he said.\\n\\nLocal govt rates will curb development: pastoralists\\nNorthern Territory pastoralists say they are worried about the prospect of having to pay local government rates from 2008.\\nAll councils will extend their jurisdiction to include cattle properties, Aboriginal and mining land in less than 18 months.\\nIn the Barkly Tableland, Paul Zlotkowsky of Amungee Mungee Station says the introduction of rates will curb development.\\n\"There\\'s talk that the whole of the area is going to be rated [on] Amungee Mungee, we use 600 square kilometres, the rest of the total area of 3,000,\" he said.\\n\"The rest of the area that is not yet developed is going to be rated.\\n\\nAncient drought blamed for megafauna destruction\\nA group of researchers say a series of massive droughts 40,000 years ago wiped out Australia\\'s megafauna.\\nIt had been previously thought that over-hunting was to blame.\\nPalaeontologist Dr Gilbert Price has dug up the fossils of giant kangaroos, emus and wombats the size of cars in south-east Queensland.\\nHe says the remains show the populations had been under stress because of dry conditions, which could provide clues to helping smaller wildlife species today.\\n\"There\\'s so many interesting ecological events that have occurred in the past and these events are recorded in places like the Darling Downs in the fossil record,\" he said.\\n\\nTask force to examine AWB charges\\nA day after Commissioner Terence Cole has handed down his final report into the activities of AWB in Iraq, 12 people are consulting lawyers about their future.\\nA special task force will investigate whether they should face criminal prosecution.\\nFormer chairman Trevor Flugge is among a group of people who Commissioner Cole has found should be further investigated for possible breaches of the Crimes and Corporations Act.\\nHe is joined by former managing director Murray Rogers and former chief financial officer Paul Ingleby.\\nAlso named are whistleblowers Mark Emons and Dominic Hogan, executives Peter Geary, Michael Long, Nigel Officer and Michael Watson, and former in-house lawyer Jim Cooper.\\nCharles Stott has been singled out for his involvement in the smelly Tigris affair, involving BHP and a 20,000 tonne wheat shipment.\\nCommissioner Cole has also recommended the Wheat Export Authority be given more powers and more money to regulate AWB but he has left AWB\\'s veto right and the future of the single desk to be sorted by the Federal Government.\\nFormer AWB managing director Andrew Lindberg says he is relieved that the Cole inquiry has cleared him of any wrongdoing.\\nBut he says it is a matter of great regret that kickbacks were paid to Iraq and he hopes it does not lead to the dismantling of the single desk for exporting Australian wheat.\\n\"Personally, I think that would be a great shame because I do believe it does provide a great benefit to Australia against heavily subsidised competition, particularly from the US and Europe,\" he said.\\n\"I think it\\'s very important that we don\\'t throw the baby out with the bath water.\"\\n\\nGrains Council\\nThe Grains Council has warned the Federal Government not to use the Cole findings as an excuse to abolish the single desk for wheat exports.\\nThe peak grains grower body says while it is shocked by the report, the conduct of AWB can not be confused with the grain marketing system.\\nChairman Murray Jones says farmers believe the single desk is the best marketing system available to them.\\n\"We\\'ve come out with six basic principles that are there and the key of that is ownership and control by growers, and I guess security of payment for pool participants,\" he said.\\n\"There are six things and they\\'re on our website. They are quite clear and the government\\'s very well aware of that.\\n\\nUN head alarmed over Tonga violence\\nThe United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan has expressed alarm about the recent violence in Tonga.\\nA spokesman for Mr Annan says he urges the parties in Tonga to persevere with inclusive national consultations to support the democratic reform process.\\nMr Annan has said he stands ready to help efforts to foster a broad political consensus.\\n\\nGovt accused of mishandling response to Cole report\\nTwo former diplomats say the Federal Government has mishandled its response to the kickback scandal, giving an advantage to Australia\\'s international wheat trade competitors.\\nAndrew Farran, now a trade policy consultant living in Victoria, says the damage to the monopoly wheat trader caused by the Cole inquiry has already caused farmers to lose wheat contracts.\\nFormer Middle East diplomat Bruce Haigh, now farming in New South Wales, says wheat growers will be angry if they lose the single desk as a result of the inquiry.\\n\"I mean the drought is already a huge burden that they\\'re having to cope with and if the single desk gets lost, it\\'ll be an even bigger blow,\" he said.\\n\"I can say from my conversations with wheat growers, that they\\'re very apprehensive and the potential there is for a lot of anger.\"\\nPrime Minister John Howard says the Federal Government is still considering a range of options for the future of the wheat export marketing system but because of the Cole inquiry findings the status quo cannot remain.\\nMr Howard acknowledges there are divisions within Government, with the Nationals pushing to keep the single desk and some Liberals demanding the removal of AWB\\'s monopoly.\\nHe says he will put forward recommendations to MPs next week but the solution decided on will be the best one for farmers.\\n\"Any changed arrangements have to be ones that work and have wide acceptability among Australian wheat growers,\" he said.\\n\"Our main concern is to protect the interests of Australian wheat growers and I am determined that whatever arrangement comes out of the discussion will protect the interests of Australian wheat growers.\"\\nMeanwhile United States Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns has directed his department to again consider banning AWB\\'s United States subsidiary from his country\\'s export programs in the wake of the Cole report.\\nMr Johanns acknowledges that the AWB had voluntarily agreed last year to not participate in the US Department of Agriculture\\'s (USDA) export credit program but adds that was pending the outcome of the Cole inquiry.\\nTop USDA lawyer Marc Kesselman says Mr Johanns has ordered him to resume debarment proceedings against AWB.\\n\"The Government can choose who it does business with and the Government usually chooses to do business with people whom it thinks are trustworthy, who are not going to commit fraud with federal dollars,\" he said.\\n\\nAgriculture sector remains largest water user\\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics says agriculture is still the biggest sector user of water in Australia but consumption has fallen by 23 per cent since 2001.\\nThe new water report says farmers and the domestic sector have both responded to the drought, with householders reducing their water consumption by 8 per cent.\\nMichael Vardon from the bureau says farmers have been particularly responsive to reduced water supplies by planting less demanding crops.\\n\"Certainly cotton and rice were large users in 2002 to 2001 and they continue to be in 2004-2005 but the water use has declined, water use has declined substantially in those industries,\" he said.\\n\\nGoulburn wins water-saving award\\nThe residents of one of Australia\\'s driest cities have been recognised for their efforts to conserve water.\\nGoulburn in southern New South Wales has halved its domestic water usage under stage five water restrictions over the past 18 months.\\nNow the council has won a National Water Conservation Award for Excellence, ahead of 700 councils from around the country.\\nGoulburn-Mulwaree Mayor Paul Stephenson says the council is now applying for state funding to install a cover for the Pejar dam to reduce evaporation.\\n\"It still allows the ultra-violet rays to get through to do the normal purification of your water, it reflects a lot of the heat,\" he said.\\n\"Your blue-green algae problems start to dissipate and you stop all the wind action because these things are moored up reasonably close together.\\n\\nWater authorities offer jobs to farmers\\nVictorian water authorities are offering jobs to farmers under a special drought employment program.\\nThe Goulburn Broken Catchment Authority has work for 60 people who are either under-employed or unemployed due to drought or recent devastating frosts in the Goulburn Valley.\\nCoomboona beef farmer Ewen Mclean is hoping to get paid for the fencing and weed control work he is planning to do on his grazing licence along the Goulburn River.\\n\\nQCC takes action against coal mine expansion\\nAn environmental group has taken legal action against a coal mine in Queensland, wanting to make it responsible for any pollution its product causes.\\nThe Queensland Conservation Council (QCC) has lodged an official objection to an extension of the Xstrata-owned Newlands coal mine, about 130 kilometres west of Mackay.\\nSpokesman Nigel Parratt says the company should invest in clean technology or plant trees to offset emissions the extracted coal will produce.\\n\"If it sets a precedent, we\\'d certainly like to see other high greenhouse gas - either emitters or users - follow suit,\" he said.\\n\\nNLIS working at major saleyards\\nNew figures show the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is working 99 per cent of the time at two of Queensland\\'s major saleyards at Roma and Dalby.\\nThe Australian Livestock and Property Agents Association says out of more than 650,000 head of cattle, less than 1 per cent either did not have electronic ear tags or had tags that were not read by scanners.\\nSpokesman Roger Lyne is pleased with the figures but says he expects them to improve.\\n\"As time goes on people are learning how to put them in better, the application rates are much better and I think also the suppliers or manufacturers of the tags are also getting better at it,\" he said.\\n\\nCompany secures $5m flour export contract\\nA company formed by six farming families in South Australia has secured a contract valued at more than $5 million to export flour into India.\\nFlinders Ranges Premium Grain will supply a frozen dough factory in northern India for the next three years, using grain grown on the shareholders\\' farms at Orroroo in the State\\'s mid-north.\\nCompany chairman Peter Barrie says negotiations have been going on for the past 13 months.\\n\"India is a land of contrasts, it can be overwhelming, their business culture generally is different,\" he said.\\n\\nVic farmer joins Gore climate change campaign\\nA Victorian farmer has joined the campaign by former United States vice-president Al Gore to increase awareness about climate change.\\nA group of 85 volunteers will set out across the country to display the slides seen in Mr Gore\\'s documentary, An Inconvenient Truth.\\nGoulburn Valley fruit grower John Pettigrew says his role is to make the presentation available to farmers.\\n\"It\\'s a matter of getting some Australian or some examples that we\\'d be more familiar with than some of the American examples he had,\" he said.\\n\"Most of us can see evidence there that we suspect is climate change.\\n\\nAWB to split\\nAWB is planning to split the company in the wake of the Cole inquiry report.\\nChairman Brendan Stewart has also announced he will stand down, once the split is approved by shareholders.\\nAs expected, the embattled wheat exporter has proposed to separate AWB International, which owns the single desk licence and service provider AWB Limited to independent companies.\\nAWBi will be wholly grower-owned and manage the national pool, while AWBl will be listed on the stock exchange and its services to AWBi will be decided in a new agreement to be voted on by shareholders at a February annual general meeting.\\nManaging director Gordon Davis will also introduce a new executive team to run the company and AWBl\\'s Mr Stewart will stand down in a bid to improve the company\\'s governance.\\nMeanwhile, BHP Billiton says an internal review into its involvement in the oil-for-food scandal has exonerated the company.\\nThe mining giant was implicated when the Cole Commission heard that BHP Petroleum had delivered a shipload of wheat to Iraq in 1996, worth millions of dollars.\\nChief executive Chip Goodyear says the internal review has reflected the Cole report finding that there is no basis for adverse findings against the company.\\n\"BHP and BHP Billiton acted consistently with the UN sanctions and Australian law,\" he said.\\n\\nAWB plan \\'not a permanent solution\\'\\nThe US wheat industry has rejected AWB\\'s plan to split the company into two separate businesses.\\nUS Wheat Associates claims the AWB split into a grower-owned operator controlling exports and a commercial agribusiness firm does not get rid of the single desk monopoly targeted by the US.\\n\"We believe that any solution that leaves a monopoly in place in Australia, Canada, wherever it is, no matter how you shuffle the boxes around or shift responsibility from one organisation to another, a monopoly is not a permanent solution,\" spokesman Steve Mercer said.\\nMr Mercer said if the new arrangement leaves in place veto power over private exports with a new organisation or Australia\\'s Wheat Export Authority it is still a monopoly and must be ended.\\nThe Australian Grains Exporters Association is also critical of the split because it will not make the market contestable until next harvest.\\nAWB will seek the approval of shareholders after its annual general meeting in February.\\nBut association spokesperson Alick Osborne says that is not good enough.\\n\"If this gets up at all, it won\\'t be until the middle of next year which is far too late for growers, particularly those growers in Western Australia, who are trying to make marketing decisions for the wheat they produce this harvest and are not comfortable with the lack of choice being provided to them today,\" Mr Osborne said.\\n\\nGraincorp\\'s profit jumps\\nEastern Australian bulk grain handler Graincorp has announced a full year after-tax profit of $39.5 million.\\nThe result is a whopping 193 per cent higher than last year\\'s result.\\nManaging director Tom Keene says the good outcome has allowed the company to pay a dividend of 50 cents a share and pay off $55 million of debt.\\nBut with only 1.9 million tonnes of grain currently in the system, he says the company is forecasting a bleak 2007.\\n\"The outlook for the current year reflects the extensive drought conditions [and] we have already provided guidance on our FY07 [2007 financial year] of a loss of between $20 to $30 million,\" he said.\\n\"As part of our strategy to manage this we continue to reduce our costs and focus on revenue improvement in a number of our business units.\"\\n\\nCattle processors in for rough ride: AMH chief\\nOne of the country\\'s biggest meat processors says meatworks in southern Australia could close due to falling cattle numbers.\\nThe chief executive of Australia Meat Holdings (AMH), John Keir, has seized upon Meat and Livestock Australia figures that show slaughter rates could fall by as much as 800,000 head next year.\\nMr Keir says with too many abattoirs and too few cattle, processors will face very tough times.\\n\"I mean if we\\'re going to see a reduction in the herd and therefor a reduction in slaughter numbers there will be surplus capacity,\" he said.\\n\\nDrought and salt tolerant crops to be available sooner\\nFarmers are set to receive new crop varieties faster with two new plant research centres being set up in Adelaide and Canberra.\\nThe National Plant Phenomics Facility will adapt the latest medical imaging technology to use on plants at the CSIRO in Canberra.\\nIn Adelaide, plants will be moved around on conveyor belts and photographed in 3D as they grow.\\nCSIRO Plant Industries chief Dr Jeremy Burdon says crops that are more drought and salt tolerant will be available

market distorted by different trade barriers and subsidies.\\n\"While Australia\\'s wheat farmers to some extent have been betrayed by the past, we\\'ve got to look to the future and offer

exporter AWB says a lack of clarity in the Federal Government\\'s changes to the wheat export system could compromise the national pool.\\nIn the wake of the Cole inquiry, the Government will take control of AWB\\'s veto power over wheat exports for six months while it discusses the future of the single desk.\\nAWB says the change will prevent the company from forecasting future earnings.\\nManaging director Gordon Davis says he will meet with Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran to discuss the impact on growers who have already delivered wheat to the national pool.\\n\"Under the previous obligations, AWBI had the ability to veto exports if it considered they weren\\'t in the interest of the national pool,\" he said.\\n\"In these transitional arrangements, the Minister will have an obligation to make decisions in the public interest.\\n\"The arrangements are very complex as they currently are and there\\'s a range of interests that need to be satisfied in any discussions.\"\\n\\nVaile\\nDeputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile says the Government will not allow Australian wheat exports to compete against each other in overseas markets.\\nThe Government will decide which companies are allowed to export wheat for the next six months, but AWB will not have to apply for an export permit.\\nMr Vaile wants the Government to gauge the views of grain grower organisations and wheat farmers before any decisions are made on the future of the export system.\\n\"We initially need to have a discussion with those groups to draw together the points of view to probably develop an options paper going forward, then that needs to be broadly discussed across the industry,\" he said.\\n\"I think that at a point in this process the best thing that we can do as a Government is communicate directly with growers.\"\\n\\nWA growers\\nMeanwhile the decision to remove AWB\\'s veto is expected to have the biggest impact on Western Australian growers, with many warehousing their wheat this harvest.\\nBut growers in the west have mixed feelings.\\n\"I think it was a good decision because there was a stalemate and I think it\\'ll be beneficial to WA wheat growers, the ones that have warehoused their wheat,\" one grower said.\\n\"It also gives protection to the farmers who have delivered into the pool.\"\\n\"Stripping the right of veto from the AWB this year, in an exceptional drought year and given to Mr McGauran could be fraught with danger,\" another grower said.\\n\"Before I allocate my wheat I want to know that CBH (Co-operative Bulk Handling) has got a realistic chance of extracting a $20 or $30 a tonne premium,\" a third wheat grower said.\\n\"If they have, well then that\\'s probably where the wheat will go.\\n\"It\\'s just on a price thing, there\\'s no loyalty left, I don\\'t think.\"\\n\\nCBH to renew export application\\nThe Government\\'s decision has opened the door for the CBH group to re-submit a rejected application to export wheat.\\nFour bids by the WA-based grain handler to send wheat to its mills in Asia have been vetoed by AWB in the past two years.\\nCBH chief executive Imre Mencshelyi says the company is likely to make a new attempt within days.\\n\"I think it is a significant first step in the changing environment that we currently find ourselves in, it is our intention to re-submit our application to export 2 million tonnes of wheat to our flour mills in Asia,\" he said.\\n\"Once the guidelines and details of the new power of veto become clear, I think that\\'s important for us to understand exactly what [the] Government means by this decision.\"\\n\\nGraincorp welcomes AWB changes\\nIn the east, Graincorp chairman Don Taylor has welcomed the change, but says he ultimately wants the single desk opened up to competition.\\n\"I think there is an opportunity for east coast growers to benefit from those changes, but it depends on the market circumstances at the particular time,\" he said.\\n\\nBarley growers divided over market deregulation\\nBarley growers in South Australia are at odds over plans to deregulate the state\\'s barley market.\\nA review has recommended the single

70s.\\nCommittee chairman Associate Professor Bob Beeton says things will get worse before they get better.\\n\"Some of the heritage properties may decline, some biodiversity may decline, river health may continue at a very low level and the CO2 levels obviously continue to increase,\" he said.\\n\"The amount of energy use in Australia is still increasing and we need to figure out what we\\'re going to do about that.\"\\nMeanwhile, the energy sector says managing climate change will be its greatest challenge for the next few decades.\\nThe Energy Futures Forum has released a report which says future investment will hinge of the industry\\'s response to climate change.\\nBut forum member Tony Wood says developing countries will have to make an effort as well.\\n\"No-one would suggest

the go-ahead to a major development to replace the ageing Midland saleyards on Perth\\'s outskirts.\\nThe livestock industry has been frustrated by the delays and cost blow-outs for the proposed Muchea yards.\\nAlthough there is still no clear time frame or cost estimate, industry representative Malcolm Edward says he is pleased to hear it is heading in the right direction.\\n\"In the past I think industry was concerned about replacing Midland, but knowing that the other regional centres needed upgrading or replacing, it had been the wish that we\\'d get a total approach to the whole thing,\" he said.\\n\\nTerritory pastoralists hopeful of receiving drought assistance\\nThere are new hopes that drought-hit pastoralists in the Northern Territory will receive federal

tantalising find for scientists wondering if the Red Planet ever has harboured life.\\nThe orbiting US spacecraft allowed scientists to detect changes in the walls of two Martian craters that may have been caused by the recent flow of water, a team of researchers say in a paper appearing in the journal Science.\\nScientists previously had established that two forms of water - ice at the poles and water vapour - exist on Mars, but liquid water is crucial to nurture life.\\nThe scientists compared images of the Martian surface taken seven years apart and found the existence of 20 newly formed craters caused by impact from space debris as well as the evidence suggesting liquid water trickling down crater walls.\\n\"These observations give the strongest evidence to date that water still flows occasionally on the surface of Mars,\" Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA\\'s Mars Exploration Program, said in a statement.\\nThe paper says water seems to have flowed down two gullies in the past few years, even though liquid water cannot remain long on the planet\\'s frigid, nearly airless surface because it would rapidly freeze or evaporate.\\nThis seemed to support the notion that liquid water may exist close enough to the planet\\'s surface in some places that it can seep out from time to time.\\nThe scientists proposed that water could remain in liquid form long enough on the surface to transport debris before freezing.\\nThe two bright new deposits are each several hundred metres long.\\nThey cited a possible alternative explanation that these features were caused by movement of dry dust down a slope. \\n\\nLife on Mars?\\nScientists long have wondered whether life ever existed on Mars.\\nLiquid water is an important part of the equation. On Earth, all forms of life require water to survive.\\nAmong the planets in our solar system, only Earth has a more hospitable climate than Mars, and some scientists suspect Mars once sheltered primitive, bacteria-like organisms.\\nPrevious missions found evidence the Red Planet at one time boasted ample quantities of water, and the question is whether liquid water is still present.\\n\"As with many discoveries, the possibility that liquid water may be coming to the surface of Mars today poses many questions,\" the scientists said.\\n\"Where is the water coming from? How is it being maintained in liquid form given the present and most likely past environments? How widespread is the water?\"\\nThey also wondered whether the water could be used as a resource for future missions to explore Mars.\\nThe two sites are inside craters in the Terra Sirenum and the Centauri Montes regions of southern Mars.\\n\"The shapes of these deposits are what you would expect to see if the material were carried by flowing water,\" Michael Malin, lead author of the paper, said.\\n\"They have finger-like branches at the downhill end and easily diverted around small obstacles.\"\\nThe researchers first reported the discovery of the gullies in 2000, but this is the first time they have revealed the presence of newly deposited material seemingly carried by liquid water.\\nLast month, NASA said the Mars Global Surveyor mission appeared to be at an end, saying it had lost contact after a decade-long mission in which it mapped the surface of Mars, tracked its climate and searched for evidence of water.\\n\\nWA fishers welcome new illegal fishing laws\\nThe fishing industry in Western Australia has welcomed new laws to toughen the nation\\'s defences against illegal fishing.\\nThe Royal Australian Navy has been given permission to shoot at uncooperative illegal fishing vessels to disable engines or rudders but not sink them.\\nKimberley Professional Fishing Association spokesman Alan Fraser believes it will be a better deterrent.\\n\"There\\'s been a lot of

to secure 100 per cent of the company, that\\'s still our intention,\" he said.\\n\"Now we know that\\'s not going to happen in the short term because we have a significant shareholder in MMC, who at this stage are not selling and that\\'s their prerogative.\"\\nChiquita has interests in the blueberry, banana, mushroom and citrus sectors.\\n\\nUS beef industry suspicious about bone chips find\\nThe US Agriculture Department wants to examine bone chips that South Korea claims it found in two rejected shipments of American beef.\\nThe US industry is suspicious about where the fragments came from.\\nUS beef industry sources argue the tiny bones the Koreans claim they found, which caused them to reject the US shipments, may not have been from animals the same age as the beef.\\nUnited States Department of Agriculture Deputy Under-Secretary Chuck Lambert is not ignoring the possibility that the shipments may have been tampered with.\\n\"We\\'ve asked to have the bone chips returned, some people have suggested DNA sampling or other means of trying to determine the origin of those bone chips,\" he said.\\nThe latest suspicions threaten to raise the US-Korea beef dispute to a new level after Korea earlier this year agreed to reopen its market following a 2003 US mad cow case.\\n\\nStudy to investigate irrigation scheme\\nThe Tasmanian Government is looking at building the state\\'s biggest irrigation scheme.\\nA study will look at the possibility of diverting water used for hydro electricity to farmers in some of the driest parts of the state.\\nFarmer Richard Gardiner says power generation should no longer be the only use for the water.\\n\"If you look at the state of water availability in the whole country and you look at the fact that there\\'s 2,000 odd megalitres a day earning $10 a megalitres, I think there is no other way we can go into the future,\" he said.\\n\\nCompany defends GM canola imports\\nThe importer of Australia\\'s first shipment of genetically modified (GM) canola says it had no choice but to buy in grain because of falling domestic production.\\nThree Greenpeace protesters had been arrested at the Port of Newcastle yesterday as they tried to block 57,000 tonnes of Canadian canola being offloaded.\\nThe grain will be processed in Newcastle and sold to unnamed buyers in the oilseed and biodiesel industries.\\nCargill Australia importer Robert Green says crop levels in the eastern states have been dramatically reduced.\\n\"The current industry estimates that the crop\\'s only been an odd 160,000 tonnes in the eastern states,

struggle to meet high feed prices, particularly in non drought-declared areas.\\nAlthough milk processors are negotiating better farm gate prices and offering interest free loans, farmers are having major problems securing reliable feed deliveries.\\nDairy consultant Bill Naughtin says some farmers are not milking as much.\\n\"I have heard on the grapevine that some people have decided to go once a day in an effort to reduce water use, but most people I have spoken to have a plan in place to feed their animals,\" he said.\\n\"The principal concern at the moment is where are they going to get the money to pay for the feed and how are they going to access feed that\\'s reasonable quality and reliable.\"\\n\\nPressure\\nDry conditions in Tasmania are putting pressure on farmers who have been agisting dairy cows for their Victorian colleagues.\\nWorsening seasonal conditions are making it harder for farmers to help, but farmer Greg Hall says they are doing their best.\\n\"When we agreed to take an extra 100 or so heifers that was some six weeks ago because there was quite a bit of rough weather on Bass Strait it took some time to get them over,\" he said.\\n\\nDrought to impact on farm incomes\\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) says farm incomes are predicted to fall this financial year because of the drought.\\nIt says farm GDP is to drop by 16 per cent and agricultural exports are likely to fall 14 per cent.\\nThe ABS figures are confirming what farmers are seeing in the paddock as their incomes are dropping, while the cost of their inputs are staying the same or rising if they are feeding expensive grain to animals.\\nMeanwhile peak farm groups in the eastern states have formed a Recovery Alliance to look at how the agriculture sector will rebuild after the drought.\\nThe group will chase further funding from the Federal Government to help farmers buy seed, fertiliser and maintain core breeding stock.\\nNew South Wales Farmers president Jock Laurie says the situation is dire for all rural communities, not just farmers.\\n\"If we get into a situation where people out there actually reduce their cropping by half, then obviously that\\'s the income halved for a lot of those small businesses,\" he said.\\n\"In circumstances like these, what we\\'re aiming to do is to try to make sure we get as much money flowing through agriculture, which then flows straight back in through those small communities - that will keep those small communities going, businesses going.\\n\"The thing about this is that it\\'s a way to help the whole regions, the whole communities, not just individual farmers.\"\\n\\nLocal community loses out\\nThe economic impact of the drought is hitting home in one small community in southern New South Wales.\\nThe Temora Shire Council says many local grain growers have not harvested a crop this year, costing the region about $100 million in lost income.\\nMayor Peter Speirs says when farmers stop spending, the whole town suffers.\\n\"It will be very hard for some of our businesses, there will probably be rationalisation of staff in some areas,\" he said.\\n\\nFires begin to merge as winds shift\\nFire authorities

all been put in a bag,\" he said.\\n\\nOpposition urges changes to croc laws\\nThe Queensland Opposition is calling for legislative changes relating to capturing crocodiles and harvesting wild crocodile eggs.\\nUnder the current system, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for the capture of problem crocodiles.\\nBut the Oppositions environment spokeswoman Rosemary Menkins says with an increasing number of crocs, more people need to help.\\n\"Our suggestion is - which is being asked for by the farmers - is to allow registered crocodile farmers to actually capture and relocate the problem animals,\" she said.\\n\"Secondly, a change in government policy that will allow the commercial harvest of wild crocodile eggs, of course under strict guidelines.\"\\n\\nGM canola shipment contaminated: AQIS\\nThe Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has confirmed a 57,000 tonne shipment of imported genetically-modified (GM) canola is contaminated with Canadian barley and weeds.\\nThe shipment arrived at the Port of Newcastle this week.\\nIt will be processed in Newcastle into protein meal and vegetable oil, and sold to the food and biodiesel industries.\\nNational manager for Plant Programs at AQIS Peter Liehne says it is common for bulk commodities to contain other material.\\n\"In this case we found that there are some seeds present in the shipment which have sufficient concern for us to look at the management of the product to ensure there is no risk to the environment resulting from these weed seeds,\" he said.\\n\\nABS revises grain storage figures\\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has been forced to re-release figures on the amount of grain in storage after the industry questioned the statistics.\\nEarlier this week, the ABS said bulk grain handling companies had more than 13 million tonnes of grain in stock, including 10 million tonnes of wheat.\\nThe revised figures show a drop to 10 million tonnes in storage overall, with wheat making up around 7 million.\\nThe bureau\\'s Karen Connaughton says there were a number of reasons for the change.\\n\"We haven\\'t undertaken this collection since December 2004 so it was quite difficult for us to verify the benchmark figure,\" she said.\\n\"We did make some efforts to verify the figure and we got some broad parameters from people, and it appears that the estimates we provided were too high.\"\\n\\nAWB wheat export veto laws passed\\nThe Federal Parliament has passed laws stripping AWB of its wheat export veto, handing it to Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran for six months.\\nMr McGauran told Parliament the move would give certainty to wheat growers, particularly in Western Australia, providing a range of options for selling their wheat.\\n\\nGold price continues to climb\\nThe gold price continues to climb on the back of a weaker US dollar and there are even predictions the price could reach $US700 by Christmas.\\nGold is once again being touted as the currency of choice on international markets as the US dollar continues to weaken.\\nCompounding that effect is the global instability generated by Iran\\'s desire to develop nuclear weapons and a move away from the greenback by that country as well as China.\\nChina has announced it will start holding euros in preference to US dollars.\\nThat has brought the bullish prediction out of Canada that gold could go above $US700 within weeks.\\n\\nDrought lowers wool production estimates\\nThe latest estimates for wool production this season have fallen further due to the drought.\\nAccording to Australian Wool Innovation, shorn wool production for 2006-07 is expected to fall 9 per cent to 421 million kilograms.\\nThe fall is due to a national

in the market at this week\\'s sales.\\n\\nFrench ask questions over cheese shipment rejection\\nThe French Government is demanding an explanation from Australian quarantine authorities over the rejection of a fourth shipment of roquefort cheese, containing high levels of E coli bacteria.\\nThe Departments of Agriculture and Foreign Affairs are in talks with French trade representatives to resolve the dispute over the non-pasteurised product.\\nThe importer, Lactalis, has stopped sending the iconic blue cheese to Australia until the two countries reach agreement over its safety.\\nLydia Buchtmann from Food Standards Australia New Zealand says authorities have to be careful of any imported raw milk product.\\n\"It\\'s a complex issue and I suppose it\\'s a question of finding out where the contamination occurs,\" she said.\\n\"Of course the last thing that the importer or the producer of the cheese wants is someone to get ill from it.\\n\\nAust wine exports up 8pc\\nThe volume of Australian wine exports has reached a record 749 million litres this year, up 8 per cent.\\nIn the latest wine export approval report, the value of wine has increased slightly by 0.2 per cent, which is the first positive result in months.\\nLawrie Stanford from the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation says demand ahead of Christmas from the UK, China and Europe has led to increased volumes.\\n\"Traditionally the Australian wine industry ships a lot of wine overseas to meet the Christmas needs and also wine has matured over the last season around this time,\" he said.\\n\"So normally our peak season is around at the moment but we\\'ve had a couple of quiet months and November is a a great catch up for us.\"\\n\\nNT growers brand small mango trays a flop\\nNew, smaller trays used to transport mangoes have been branded a failure by many growers in the Northern Territory.\\nThe major supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths introduced the 12 per layer trays to reduce handling.\\nBut they are estimated to have cost Territory packing houses more than $2 million, which is not being recouped in the marketplace.\\nKarl Gygar from Pinata Marketings says the supermarkets will have to accept the trays are not working.\\n\"Customers are looking at these boxes and thinking that they\\'re either rejects from Coles and Woolworths, and so obviously not worth a premium price,\" he said.\\n\"I know for a fact that a lot of Queensland growers have cancelled their 12 per layer box orders just due to the reaction in the market.\"\\n\\nBuffalo whisperer hopes for more support to send buffaloes to Aceh\\nEfforts have begun to send another shipment of trained buffaloes from the Northern Territory to the Indonesian province of Aceh.\\nSeven water buffalo were sent to remote rural villages earlier this year to help residents recover from the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami.\\nBuffalo whisperer Graham Heffernan says the villagers have been frustrated by delays in replacing their important beasts of burden.\\nHe is hoping the Federal Government will support plans to send another 50 by April.\\n\"One of the first things one of the farmers said to me was, \\'why so long\\'?\" Mr Heffernan said.\\n\"He wasn\\'t having a go at me ... taking so long to get the buffalos there, it was like, \\'all this other aid has happened here in Aceh, why has it taken so long for someone to bring buffaloes to us, because that\\'s what we really need\\'.\\n\"And that\\'s just the beginning you know. Like hopefully in 12-18 months we may be sending them in hundreds per month.\"\\nThe first Australian aid donation of trained water buffalo was the result of an unlikely alliance between a buffalo whisperer, a private benefactor, Newcastle surfers, the live export industry, shipping, fodder, trucking and quarantine authorities.\\n\\nFarmers urged to consider growing truffles\\nFarmers looking to diversify after the drought are being urged to look at producing truffles.\\nIt takes at least five years to produce up to 40 kilograms of truffles a hectare.\\nThe exotic french fungus is currently fetching $3,000 a kilogram.\\nThe Australian Truffle Growers Association is having its inaugural meeting this weekend near Canberra, although grower Wayne Haslam says potential newcomers

keen to help.\\n\"The drought\\'s so bad the farmers have got no food and yet when I was parked at Darlington Point I was swimming in the river with my grandchildren and I got out, and somebody had left a bag of horse feed for me,\" she said.\\n\"I didn\\'t even know who they were, they didn\\'t even say hello, they just dropped it off there for me.\\n\\nDrought won\\'t stop delivery of PM\\'s Xmas tree\\nNot even the festive season can escape the drought, with this year\\'s harvest of Christmas trees producing smaller trees than usual due to poor rainfall.\\nChristmas tree farmer Gary Black from Gippsland in Victoria says trees from the southern states are in high demand.\\nHe says one of his special customers will receive the best tree he has to offer.\\n\\nSenate committee members reject petrol inquiry report\\nMembers of a Senate committee investigating petrol prices have rejected the inquiry\\'s final report, prepared by Liberal Senator George Brandis.\\nThe report concludes market fluctuations save motorists money, further regulation would cost them more and the Federal Government cannot influence the higher prices paid in rural areas.\\nDeputy chairwoman of the Senate Economics Committee Labor Senator Ursula Stephens says the report\\'s conclusions are unacceptable.\\n\"There was great disappointment by the recommendations which really supported the status quo and found there was nothing that could be done that could alleviate higher petrol prices for country people,\" she said.\\n\\nWheat export system should focus on grower returns, Crean says\\nThe Opposition\\'s new trade spokesman, Simon Crean, says the single desk wheat export system should not be used as a bargaining chip in world trade talks.\\nPrime Minister John Howard has said the Government will be careful it does not throw away the single desk without getting something in return in the international arena.\\nBut Mr Crean says if Labor won government it would place more importance on maximising returns to wheat growers and making sure the system was properly scrutinised.\\n\"This can\\'t be seen as a bargaining chip, it has to be seen as ensuring the return to viability and integrity in our wheat trade,\" he said.\\nMeanwhile Wheat Australia, the consortium of grain handlers ABB, CBH and Graincorp, has re-submitted its export application for 500,000 tonnes of wheat to Iraq.\\nIt follows the decision last week by the Federal Government to shift the veto power over wheat exports from AWB to Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran.\\nEast coast grain handler Graincorp has also made four applications to export wheat to Japan, Europe, Indonesia and Malaysia, totalling more than 200,000 tonnes.\\nIn another development, grain analysts are predicting global stocks to fall to the lowest level in 20 years next season, as drought conditions hit most wheat-producing countries.\\nThe United States Department of Agriculture predicts global wheat stocks will drop to 119 million tonnes next year, the lowest levels seen in two decades, thanks to drought and difficult planting conditions around the world.\\nAs a result, this year\\'s high prices are likely to continue into 2007, with the competition between fuel industries and food adding to the pressure.\\nGrains analyst Lloyd George says the so-called food versus fuel factor is significant.\\n\"The biggest surprise factor that\\'s happened on a long term basis, the emergence of biofuels would be right up there,\" he said.\\n\"There\\'s strong incentives to use these biofuels in a number of different countries and I\\'d expect that to continue.\"\\n\\nSaleyards used to protect shelter stock\\nAs bushfires continue to burn in Victoria, local saleyards are being used to shelter

what water we\\'ve got,\" he said.\\n\"In the Murray Darling Basin, we\\'ve identified 3,000 gigalitres that\\'s going to disappear out of the system due to climate change, fires, forest interception.\\n\\nEyre Peninsula farmers may have to shoot sheep\\nFarmers on Eyre Peninsula in South Australia may have to shoot their sheep in the next few months because they cannot afford to feed them or send them to market.\\nLocal producer Andrew Mills says low prices being paid for sheep and lambs, combined with the high cost of transport to saleyards north of Adelaide, is forcing tough decisions.\\nHe says the glut of sheep and lambs from interstate makes it difficult to even book sheep and lambs into abattoirs.\\n\"In the next few months you might see quite a few sheep from Eyre Peninsula that will just have to be slaughtered and buried if the numbers keep coming out of Victoria,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s got to the stage this week that unless they are very good sheep, you\\'ll get a bill if you send them to Adelaide.\\n\\nWine grape growers may run out of water\\nSome wine grape growers in South Australia\\'s Riverland could run out of irrigation water as early as next month.\\nThe state\\'s Murray River irrigators are currently only able to use 60 per cent of their entitlement.\\nViticulturist Peter Burne says with the ongoing dry, irrigators are using more water than usual.\\n\"A lot of growers have already gone over 30 per cent of their total allocation for the year,\" he said.\\n\\nDept hopes sediment flow into Lake Argyle will decrease\\nAuthorities hope they have slowed down the amount of soil running into Australia\\'s largest inland sea, Lake Argyle, in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.\\nA decade ago, scientists estimated the Ord River Irrigation Scheme\\'s main reservoir would lose 30 per cent of its storage capacity in the next 100 years.\\nBut sediment levels have recently been surveyed again and Duncan Palmer from the Department of Water hopes they show a slow-down of nutrient build up from wet season run-off.\\n\\nPGA to fight for farmers\\' water rights\\nThe Western Australian Pastoralist and Graziers Association (PGA) says it will fight to maintain farmers\\' water rights after an Environmental Protection Authority report allowed 45 gigalitres of water to be transported to Perth from the southern Yarragadee aquifer.\\nThe report, released late last week, says the Water Corporation can sustainably draw water from the aquifer without harming the environment.\\nBut farmers are concerned their future water needs have been overlooked.\\nWater spokesman for the PGA, Dave Wren, says it is time Perth started developing its own water saving strategies.\\n\"The National Water Initiative calls for each catchment to have a plan - Perth has not got a plan,\" he said.\\n\"There\\'s at least 112 gigalitres of water being pumped from domestic bores unlicensed and unmetered, there\\'s recycling opportunities in Perth that have been identified.\\n\\nNSW farm wins imported mushrooms anti-dumping case\\nA three-year anti-dumping case on imported mushrooms has now been resolved in favour of an Australian processor.\\nThe Federal Government has upheld its decision to put anti-dumping measures in place against Chinese tinned mushrooms.\\nMichael Leahy, from Windsor Farms in central New South Wales, says his company is now considering action on dumped tomatoes, potatoes and corn but has urged the Federal Government to speed up the complaints process.\\n\"What it needs is clarification and some administrative changes inside the Act under which they operate,\" he said.\\n\"But also it probably needs to be resourced sufficiently to conduct the investigations quickly enough.\\n\\nCommittee pushes for act of Parliament to handle private logging\\nA New South Wales committee trying to resolve a 20-year debate over the management of privately owned native forests wants a separate act of Parliament developed to deal with the issue.\\nThere are 8.5 million hectares of private timber resources in the state and green groups want tighter controls on logging.\\nThe Primary Industries and Economic Development Committee, which is advising the State Government, has until the end of the year to resolve the long-running debate or risk industry losing control of the forests to the State Government.\\nCommittee chair Craig Tate says the issue is not simply about regulating timber harvesting.\\n\"We have small communities out there that depend on the timber industry and the private resource is a multi-million dollar industry and we have to be very careful how we deal with it,\" he said.\\n\"But also we are in a major environmental situation at the moment.\\n\\nBath sponge has potential global demand, scientist says\\nMarine researchers have discovered properties of the golden bath sponge that will benefit agriculture, pearling and medicine.\\nDr Chris Battershill, of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, says more work is needed to successfully farm sponges.\\n\"In the agricultural sector the leads can be taken right through to market and quite quickly,\" he said.\\n\"Australia is leading the globe in many of the areas of farm husbandry and maintenance, if you like, but also in the bio-medicinal sector, there is now a capability to take things into the clinic.\\n\\nGovt not dealing quickly enough with global warming concerns: Garrett\\nThe Opposition\\'s new environment spokesman says a federal Labor Government would be more responsive to farmers\\' concerns about climate change.\\nPeter Garrett, a former head of the Australian Conservation Foundation, was appointed in Kevin Rudd\\'s weekend frontbench reshuffle.\\nOthers with new portfolios relevant to rural Australia include Kerry O\\'Brien in primary industries, Simon Crean in trade and regional development, Anthony Albanese in water, and Chris Evans in resources.\\nMr Garrett says the Federal Government is not dealing quickly enough with community concerns about global warming.\\n\\nGlobal commodities demand to prop up farm sector\\nDespite drought conditions and plunging farm incomes, high global demand for commodities is expected to keep Australia\\'s farm sector afloat in 2007, with prices up 16 per cent on the same time last year.\\nThe Westpac Rural Commodity Index also shows rising rural land values are providing a buffer against debt and will be the main driver in post-drought recovery.\\nWestpac\\'s Justin Smirk says most farmers will be able to withstand a drop in income next year.\\n\"Over the last five years Australia\\'s top farmers have actually been generating rates of return that match if not exceed a lot of rates of return we see in other assets around Australia,\" he said.\\n\\nNFF hits out at make up of carbon emissions task force\\nThe National Farmers Federation (NFF) is angry at the make-up of Prime Minister John Howard\\'s new task force to investigate carbon emissions trading.\\nPresident David Crombie says stacking the group with mining and energy interests has hurt any real attempts to address climate change.\\nSenior staff from BHP Billiton, Qantas, Xstrata Alumina and the National Bank will join Federal Government bureaucrats on the task force.\\nMr Crombie says it is extremely short-sighted of Mr Howard to exclude agriculture and other sector interests.\\n\"Farmers do have it within their capacity to contribute to reducing emissions, which are one of the major causes of greenhouse gas change and are linked with climate change,\" Mr Crombie said.\\n\"If farmers have a role to play there, which I believe they do, then it\\'s important that they be part of any long term plan going forward.\"\\nMeanwhile a national emissions trading summit in Sydney has been told agriculture is paying the price for a century of pollution generated by the coal and resources sectors.\\nAustralian Greens Senator Christine Milne says the Federal Government must set a national cap on emissions and coal companies should be forced to comply.\\nSenator Milne says the resources sector has made massive profits and agriculture has suffered as a consequence.\\n\"We now have rural Australia suffering with extreme bushfires, with the collapse of their whole agricultural productive system because of climate change,\" she said.\\n\"They are not being compensated for that by the coal industry so it\\'s time that the resource-based industries recognised that they have got a role to play.\\n\\nGrowers warned not to sign contracts\\nThere are claims today agents and merchants in the fruit and vegetable markets are trying to get around the looming mandatory code of conduct.\\nGrowers say they are being offered contracts before the new code is introduced into Federal Parliament.\\nThe code aims to make the sales process more transparent, so growers can see what happens with their products.\\nPeter Darley from the New South Wales Farmers Association says growers should not sign anything just yet.\\n\"I have had phone calls from producers as of yesterday saying that there are ... contracts being presented by agents for them to look at and consider the obligations of signing contracts,\" he said.\\n\"I would suggest to growers at this stage the code has not been enacted on yet in Parliament.\\n\"If they are going to sign, that they certainly get an independent opinion before they go ahead and sign those contracts in consideration of their business.\"\\nThe wholesale sector admits it is trying to circumvent the code before it is made law.\\n\\nTas bushfire damage \\'severe\\'\\nHouses, pasture and fencing have been destroyed in a 10,000 hectare fire on Tasmania\\'s north-east coast.\\nAn assessment of damage is expected later today but at least 18 houses have been destroyed in the town of Scamander.\\nLocal vet Tim McManus says the extent of stock losses is not yet known but at least one farm has suffered extensively.\\n\"Glencoe around us had very severe fire damage, many of their paddocks are burnt and even now some of the bushland around them is still burning,\" he said.\\n\\nVolunteer firefighters battle Vic blazes\\nVolunteer firefighters in Victoria are continuing to pour into the mountains to relieve weary colleagues.\\nMilder conditions are helping firefighting efforts, although temperatures are due to climb again later this week.\\nMyrrhee in the north-eastern King Valley is not under direct threat, so members of its fire brigade have joined the frontline effort.\\nCaptain Bill Forge says the volunteers are doing all they can.\\n\"Our crew have been working from fires at Whitfield for the last week, they\\'re not at Myrrhee at all most of them,\" he said.\\n\\nLabor pushes for wheat export system inquiry\\nFederal Labor\\'s new primary industries spokesman wants an independent inquiry into whether the single desk wheat export system delivers the best value to growers.\\nTasmanian Senator Kerry O\\'Brien says while the system delivers the best value to growers and the community, Labor will support it.\\nBut he says the Federal Government should be appointing an independent group that would investigate wheat export marketing and report publicly to Parliament.\\n\"To have the community debate that report, rather than this closed door approach to consultation that the Government has,\" he said.\\n\\nUS committee chief to let Senate decide on AWB probe\\nThe new chairman of the US House Agriculture Committee says he will leave it up to the US Senate to probe the AWB scandal, but will look at ways to prevent problems in the future.\\nCollin Petersen says he is not interested in \"assigning blame\" based on \"past history\", but in dealing with the monopoly practices of the AWB and the Canadian Wheat Board for the future: \"We\\'re not happy about the Australian Wheat Board, we think that having this kind of a system is not fair and not right, and we\\'ve been trying to get rid of it for a long time, some of us,\" he said.\\n\"So we will be watching to see how this is reconstituted and whether it is going to be done in a way that is transparent, or whether it\\'s going to be utilised to undercut us when we\\'re trying to go into other markets.\"\\nMr Petersen expects the Senate, under new democratic leadership, to look at why the just-ended Republican Congress dropped any plans to probe the oil for food scandal.\\nMeanwhile wheat exporter AWB has dropped prices for the 2006/07 national pool by $8 a tonne.\\nThe company blames a weaker international market for the decline, with the benchmark premium white wheat now returning $242 a tonne.\\n\\nRice crop expected to drop\\nThis year\\'s rice crop will be one of the smallest in more than 50 years due to cuts to water allocations in southern New South Wales.\\nThe Department of Primary Industries estimates less than 12,000 hectares of rice has been sown, only 10 per cent of average plantings.\\nOther industry sources say the figure is more like 15,000 hectares, which will yield around 130,000 tonnes of rice.\\nGriffith district rice grower Glen Andreazza says the late reduction in water allocation means he has had to abandon his rice crop.\\n\"I had sown 80 acres of rice and had to de-water all of it,\" he said.\\n\"It was to the point where all I had to do was to keep water on it and watch it grow.\\n\\nBass Coast applies for EC assistance\\nOne of the greenest parts of southern Australia is now putting its hand up for exceptional circumstances (EC) drought assistance.\\nFarmers on the Bass Coast in southern Victoria say they are suffering one of the worst seasons on record.\\nStephanie Symes from the Bass Coast Shire Council says district farmers are used to much wetter conditions.\\n\"It\\'s the first time we\\'ve ever had stage four water restrictions applied,\" she said.\\n\\nExtra funds allocated for Qld sugar industry reform\\nThe Federal Government has announced another $33 million to reform the sugar industry in Queensland.\\nOne of the plans is to generate a third of Mackay\\'s energy needs from nearby cane fields.\\nUnder a $95 million project, the Mackay Sugar Co-operative will transform one its mills to convert sugar cane waste into steam and then electricity.\\nChief executive John Pollock says the funding will kickstart the plant.\\n\"We\\'re really pleased that $12 million that the Government have seen the value of the project and we presume that it\\'s funding the early stages of that project rather then the latter stages,\" he said.\\n\\nCamels sold as weed eaters in Qld\\nPrices have fallen at Australia\\'s third commercial camel sale but organisers say there is a growing market for using the animals as weed eaters.\\nCamel breeder Paddy McHugh has sold 67 camels under the hammer at the Gracemere saleyards in central Queensland.\\nHe says while a few camels were bought to boost breeding numbers, most will have new jobs managing weeds.\\n\"That\\'s probably the most predominant use of them at the moment, is to eat the parkinsonia and prickly acacia and all the wattle regrowth,\" he said.\\n\"They do a great job and they coexist with cattle - they\\'ve got all sorts of funny little things, the ruminant bug they pass on.\\n\\nDrought forcing vegetable prices up\\nShoppers are being warned that vegetable prices could rise by 30 per cent before Christmas, and even double in January, as the drought continues to hurt production.\\nBut grower groups are worried that price hikes at the retail level are not being passed back to farmers, with many locked into contracts that do not recognise higher costs.\\nAusVeg chairman Mike Badcock says some growers have raised concerns about profiteering during the drought.\\n\"I think while we can keep spreading the word that we\\'ll be looking very hard at margins and the returns to growers, hopefully that keeps everybody honest. There\\'s an opportunity here to reward growers who have done the right thing, drought proofed their farm and they do need some reward for that,\" he said.\\nThe Australian Consumer and Competition Commission is reviewing prices in the meat industry as well, with a report due next week.\\nAnd it is not just the drought that is set to hurt prices.\\nFruit and vegetable growers in southern Queensland are counting the cost of devastating hail storms which swept through the region late yesterday.\\nWhile up to 90 millimetres of rain was recorded in gauges on the Darling Downs, the hail has left a multi-million dollar damage bill.\\nGrowers have reported damage to crops of cabbages, strawberries, plums, table grapes, tomatoes, mangoes and avocadoes and Stanthorpe lettuce grower Dean Radin says that could mean a price rise at the supermarket.\\n\\nWholesalers not happy with fruit and veg code\\nThe controversial regulatory code of conduct for the fruit and vegetable industry is expected to be signed off by the Governor-General today.\\nBut sections of the industry still are not happy with it.\\nThe code specifies how wholesalers and growers must deal with each other in the future, but excludes supermarkets, the big retailers and processors.\\nWholesaler Andrew Young, from the Central Markets Association of Australia, says the code he has seen will be a cost burden for everyone.\\n\"It adds significant administration costs. There\\'s legal requirements that have been introduced, which growers must obtain legal advice prior to executing an agreement with a wholesaler. There\\'s much more prescription in terms of how wholesalers can and cannot act and virtually requiring in excess 90 per cent of the industry to totally change how they\\'ve done business for many many years,\" he said.\\n\\nZinifex and Umicore link for zinc\\nAustralia\\'s largest lead and zinc miner will combine its smelting assets with a Belgian company to become the world\\'s biggest producer of zinc alloy.\\nZinifex has signed a memorandum of understanding with Umicore to form a global company to produce 1.2 million tonnes of zinc and alloys a year.\\nZinifex says it wants to concentrate on mining, but spokesman Martin MacFarlane says existing smelter operations in Hobart and Port Pirie will not be affected.\\n\"Those businesses tomorrow will continue on much as they have today, there\\'s no change to any of the employees terms and conditions for the short to medium term future - we see the business will be very much as it is today,\" he said.\\n\"Longer term, however, it may create and open opportunities that may not have been otherwise available just from the fact that Zinifex did not wish to develop that side of the business.\"\\n\\nJapan agrees to export talks\\nDespite concern over the impact on its agriculture sector, Japan has agreed to discuss better access for Australian farm exports under a possible free trade agreement.\\nFormal talks on the trade deal will start early next year, which the Federal Government believes could be worth $39 billion to Australia over 20 years.\\nTrade Minister Warren Truss says Japan might push for more opportunities to sell niche products to Australia, but farmers here should receive the biggest gains.\\n\"We are exporting a lot of beef into Japan at the present time, but all of it is paying 40 per cent or more tariffs,\" he said.\\n\\nDeadline for potential wheat exporters looms\\nThe Federal Government wants potential wheat exporters to submit their applications by Friday, to give certainty to grain growers during the harvest.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran now has the power of veto over export applications, after its removal from AWB in the wake of the Cole inquiry.\\nMr McGauran says applications will be assessed on public interest grounds to maximise returns to the industry.\\n\\nHoward visits Vic firefighters\\nPrime Minister John Howard has visited firefighters in north-east Victoria, as they continue to battle bushfires which have now burnt 400,000 hectares.\\nThick smoke covered Whitfield as residents and Country Fire Authority (CFA) volunteers met with the Prime Minister today.\\nMade up of beef properties and vineyards, the Whitfield area in the north-east of Victoria has been threatened by fire since lightning strikes hit there a week and a half ago.\\nJohn Howard has thanked firefighters for their work, and got a briefing on the fire conditions which are expected to last many weeks.\\nHe also spoke with locals, mostly women, who are busy making cups of tea and sandwiches for the crew.\\nHe will visit the fire ground before flying to Tasmania, where he is expected to make a funding announcement.\\nMeanwhile cooler weather on Tasmania\\'s east coast is helping firefighters control a bushfire which has burnt more than 11,500 hectares and destroyed 17 homes.\\nFirefighters are working to contain the fire ahead of forecast hotter and winder conditions tomorrow.\\nFarmer Stephen Woods, whose two farms near Scamander were already hit by drought, has saved his livestock, but lost more than 100,000 of pasture and another 700 hectares of bush.\\n\\nGorgon gas field development given green light\\nThe WA Government has given the environmental nod to the development of the Gorgon gas field on Barrow Island.\\nThe island, off the Pilbara Coast, is a reserve that is home to the rare flatback turtle and other endangered species.\\n\\nDrought stalls dairy-based managed investment scheme\\nThe development of the nation\\'s first dairy-based managed investment scheme has stalled due to the drought.\\nCarilla Dairy at Tintinara in South Australia\\'s south-east has failed to find enough cows because of a lack of feed.\\nThe company needs 2,000 head before it can issue a prospectus, but only has 1,200.\\nPeter Doman from Dairy Management Australia says despite the delays, he is confident the scheme will be successful.\\n\"We\\'re going to try and keep on track, but obviously this year has presented its problems for us,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve just got to work towards what we\\'re going to do over the next 12 months. As you said, it\\'s the first dairy farm that\\'s going to be involved in a scheme, we think it\\'ll be sold next year and we think it\\'ll go very very well.\\nThe drought is hitting the dairy sector in general, with milk production dropping below the past two seasons.\\n\\nEMS accreditation doesn\\'t attract premium price: study\\nA study has found consumers will not pay extra for food just because it has environmental credentials.\\nIncreasingly farms are adopting environment management systems (EMS), which can cost up to $10,000 to implement.\\nThe Australian Farm Institute has found products stamped with an EMS accreditation do not attract premiums, because consumers expect farmers to be environmentally responsible.\\nBut spokesman Mick Keogh says the EMS system is useful to win new markets.\\n\\nAquifers being badly mismanaged: letter\\nAustralia\\'s underground water supplies are in crisis, according to a letter that has been sent to all levels of government.\\nWritten by seven of the country\\'s leading hydro-geologists from the public and private sectors, the document says Australia\\'s aquifers are being badly mismanaged.\\nSpokesman Dr Rick Evans says on every level, from policy to education, efforts are aimed at repairing rivers, instead of restoring groundwater.\\n\\nSanta gets helping hand from businessman\\nAn anonymous Sydney businessman has donated $150,000 to buy Christmas hampers for drought affected families in western New South Wales.\\nThe donor says he wanted to let struggling families know that people in the cities do care about them.\\nJamie Simmons from Broken Hill\\'s Christian City Church hopes it will make a little difference.\\n\\nSaleyards industry worried about livestock dumping\\nWith sheep selling for as little as 10 cents a head in some parts of the country, the New South Wales Shires Association is calling on saleyards to waive their fees.\\nBut the industry is worried that saleyards could become a dumping ground for livestock in poor condition.\\nDavid Pollock from the Livestock Saleyards Association of Victoria says farmers must consider the welfare of their animals.\\n\"People should consider whether the animal is fit to load and to be transported, and go through the rigours of the saleyard process before it\\'s sent there,\" he said.\\n\"And if it\\'s not in that condition, well then it shouldn\\'t come to the saleyard.\"\\nAnd the RSPCA is urging graziers to look after their livestock following the conviction of a 54-year-old farmer from southern New South Wales.\\nLlewellyn Mark Doulman was convicted on 77 breaches of the Cruelty to Animals Act for his treatment of 2,500 sheep.\\n\\nCourt asked to streamline AWI case\\nAustralian Wool Innovation (AWI) has asked the Federal Court to streamline its case against the animal rights group PETA.\\nThe peak wool body wants the claims of 101 woolgrowers heard separately, leaving AWI, Elders Limited and BWK Elders Australia to go to trial against PETA and Animal Liberation New South Wales.\\nAWI started its case against PETA in November 2004 and joined the woolgrowers to the action in March, 2005.\\nAWI\\'s counsel told Justice Rares his client proposed corralling the woolgrowers separately for efficiency reasons to streamline the case.\\nBut PETA\\'s barrister Michael Jones said this would prejudice his client because PETA wanted access to the farmers\\' contracts for sale of wool, financial records and mulesing information.\\n\\nWeather conditions to test firefighters\\nHot and windy weather this afternoon is expected to test firefighters battling a large fire near Tumut, in southern New South Wales.\\nThe fire has burnt 13,000 hectares - mainly pine plantations.\\nLandholders in the Argalong and Goobruhgandra valleys have been on high alert since yesterday afternoon, when the fire breached containment lines.\\nA handful of people have been relocated.\\nLast night firefighters were able to put in new containment lines but with hot north-westerly winds forecast for this afternoon there is concern there might be spot-overs.\\nRural Fire Service Commissioner Phil Koperberg is touring the region and an extra 70 fire brigades have been brought in.\\nA sky crane helicopter is also adding to the aerial attack.\\nForests New South Wales will attempt to salvage timber from the burnt pine plantations near Tumut.\\nAt least 10,000 hectares of pines have been burnt so far.\\nSpokesman Bob Almond says trees that have been blackened can still be salvaged, but there is a time limit.\\n\\nMilk tankers help out firefighting effort\\nDairy processor Murray Goulburn has come to the aid of Victorian firefighters who are battling blazes in hot and windy conditions today.\\nMilk tankers are being filled with water and taken to the fire front for the Country Fire Authority.\\nBrad Stokel from Murray Goulburn says the tankers will be used for as long as they are needed.\\n\"We\\'ve got tankers available and we put those in the locations that they request,\" he said.\\n\\nBush called on to halt S Korea free trade talks\\nKey US farm state senators are demanding the Bush Administration end free trade talks with South Korea, until Seoul ends a defacto ban on imports of US beef.\\nThe seven senators made their request after the Koreans rejected three US beef shipments on claims the meat had tiny bone fragments.\\nAgriculture committee spokesman Keith Williams says the law-makers just ran out of patience.\\n\"Unless the exports of US beef resume and both countries are able to agree on a reasonable and fair bone tolerance level for future shipments, then, anything less than that, would result in the opposition of the senators that signed this letter,\" he said.\\n\\nAdministrator looks into Co-op\\'s finances\\nThe administrator of a fruit growers\\' cooperative in southern New South Wales has told grower creditors that they will only get around a quarter of their money back.\\nThe Young District Producers\\' Cooperative Society, which processed dried fruit, went into voluntary administration with outstanding debts of about $2.6 million.\\nAdministrator Steve Parbery says there are also concerns the Co-op may have been trading while insolvent.\\n\"The question mark arises as to why the Co-op ended up in this position and it would appear that the accounting that was done prior to June 06,\" he said.\\n\\nWin for avocado growers in blight fight\\nAvocado growers have won their fight for tougher restrictions to protect the industry from the fungal disease, avocado blight.\\nBiosecurity Australia has imposed stronger rules for imported New Zealand avocado, including a ban on any fruit with windrub, which looks the same as blight.\\nAvocadoes Australia\\'s Chris Nelson says the new protocols could lead to a rise in the cost of fruit for consumers.\\n\"Because there will be less fruit exported to Australia there will be a change in that supply and demand balance and inevitably I guess the prices may rise to a certain extent so they\\'re looking towards probably a better return for the fruit they do send over,\" he said.\\nRandom inspections will be conducted on Australian fruit orchards this summer to ensure growers are not breaching plant breeders\\' rights.\\n\\nFishing sector angry over marine park plan\\nWestern Australia\\'s commercial fishing sector is angry that is has not been consulted about new marine parks planned for the state\\'s north-west.\\nThe State Government will create the parks, as part of an attempt to protect the environment, once the $15 billion Gorgon gas field is developed on Barrow Island.\\nBut Guy Leyland from the WA Fishing Industry Council says the $130 million sector was not told about the plans, and still knows little about what is proposed.\\n\"We learnt about an hour before the public announcement by the Minister,\" he said.\\n\"The Minister telephoned us and advised us that this is what the Government was going to do.\\n\"It\\'s just pointing to I think that we weren\\'t consulted more closely in terms of the Government\\'s intention.\\n\\nWool prices up\\nWool prices have ended on a positive note at the final Sydney auctions for 2006. \\n   \\nThe northern wool market indicator has finished on 858 cents a kilo, up 11 cents on last week.\\nThe last sales for the year are being held in Melbourne and Fremantle today, and wool broker Don MacDonald expects prices to stay firm.\\n\"Yes I would think so, supply is now the main issue and I can\\'t see any way the market will flag off today,\" he said.\\n\\nDrought expected to drive more from farms\\nDemographers and farm organisations say the severity of the drought is likely to accelerate the trend of primary producers leaving the land.\\nThe National Farmers Federation says it does not expect an exodus, but the drought will continue the trend of fewer farmers running bigger properties.\\nSocial researcher for the Victorian Department of Primary Industries, Dr Neil Barr, says history suggests fewer young people will become farmers.\\n\"In the census period before the 1983 drought there were 10,000 people aged in their late 20s, 25-30 that entered farming in the five years before it, and then in the late 1980s that had dropped to 6,000,\" he said.\\n\\nBushfire battle continues in Tas\\nFirefighters continue to battle large bushfires threatening the townships of St Mary\\'s and Irish Town in Tasmania\\'s north-east.\\nThe fire front is about a kilometre north of the towns, near the German Town Road, and fanned by north-easterly winds.\\nTasmanian Fire Service district officer Steve Lowe says crews are working on control burning while conditions allow, but are bracing for an unfavourable weather change tomorrow,\\n\"It\\'s still moving quite slowly at this time however the forecast is not favourable for firefighting at all,\" he said.\\n\\nPressure mounts for quick wheat exports decision\\nPressure is building on the Federal Government to make a quick decision on wheat exports, with at least half a dozen companies lodging applications.\\nAgriculture Minister Peter McGauran now has the final say on who should be allowed to export wheat after the removal of AWB\\'s veto in the wake of the Cole inquiry.\\nSources say Brooks Grain, Cargill, Ozepulse and Louis Dreyfus are among several exporters who have lodged the latest bids for around 3 million tonnes.\\nBut Peter Howard from Ozepulse says it is still unclear if the new system will make it easier for AWB\\'s rivals to export wheat.\\n\"It\\'s new so there is a lack of clarity, I mean we\\'re guessing what\\'s going to happen,\" he said.\\n\"I would hardly consider it would have any adverse effect on the national pool.\\n\"I can\\'t see if you grant another competitor an approval they\\'ve still got to buy the wheat, presumably you can\\'t buy it for any less than what AWB are offering you\\'ve got to pay more.\\n\\nMother of injured horse rider backs hard hats\\nThe Northern Territory\\'s outback community is rallying around a severely injured campdrafter.\\nQuita Docking is recovering from a head injury she received four years ago, when she was crushed by her horse.\\nIn a miraculous recovery, she has left her wheelchair and learnt to walk, and ride again.\\nMother Gladys Docking says she is grateful for local support which helped to send Quita to Germany for stem cell therapy.\\nShe also wants to encourage all riders to wear hard hats.\\n\"Quita was always against it, as a teenager. I was always, always trying to get her to wear it,\" she said.\\n\"[She] never would, but [I continue to encourage use], now more so than ever. Quita would still have suffered injuries, but they would have been minimised.\\n\"It doesn\\'t take much to have a bit of a hot head for a couple of hours, you can take it off when you are off the horse.\\n\\nWool market ends year on high note\\nThe wool market has ended the year strongly, with the eastern market indicator up 14 cents to 839 cents a kilogram.\\nFollowing solid gains in the Sydney sales early in the week, prices in Melbourne jumped 16 per cent.\\nMerino fleece wools were in strong demand, with price rises across all micron types.\\nBuyers from China have dominated sales this year but a pick up in demand from other countries has been a major factor in lifting the market.\\n\\nCourt date set for AWI case\\nA trial date has finally been set for Australian Wool Innovation\\'s (AWI) long-running case against the animal rights group, PETA.\\nThe Federal Court will hear the case over two months from October next year.\\nLegal action was launched against PETA in 2004 after it mounted an international campaign to boycott Australian wool, over the practice of mulesing and live exports.\\nLes Targ from AWI says the peak body plans to call more than 30 witnesses.\\n\"I won\\'t be specific about names but obviously we\\'ll be talking people who are experts in the area of fly control and experts in the geographic regions, and the effect of flies in those regions, so we\\'ll be calling on a range of experts,\" he said.\\n\\nRoma saleyards for sale\\nAustralia\\'s biggest saleyard complex is on the market.\\nThe council-owned Roma saleyards in southern Queensland will most likely be put out to tender in the New Year.\\nBut yard managers are already denying a possible sale will squeeze out smaller independent agents in favour of big companies like Elders and Landmark.\\nChairman of the Roma saleyards board Rob Loughnan says it is early days in the tender process and a sale would have to benefit all parties.\\n\"I want to hear from people about whether they think it would be better in private or public ownership,\" he said.\\n\"Its not just he money we\\'re talking about, if someone wants to buy it just to shut it down in favour of another centre somewhere, you know, away from Roma, so Roma loses the benefit of 400,000 cattle throughput a year, that\\'s not going to be of interest to us,\" he said.\\nMajor livestock agent Elders has denied it is behind the possible sale of Roma.\\nQueensland livestock manager, Tony Gooden is rejecting speculation that his company is either interested in buying the yards, or setting up its own facility in competition to the council-run centre.\\n\\nTas bushfires wipe out $50m plantation timber\\nTasmania\\'s bushfires have destroyed plantation timber worth an estimated $50 million.\\nAbout 17,000 hectares of bush has been burnt on the north-east coast since the fire began last weekend.\\nKim Creak from Forestry Tasmania says it is too early for accurate assessments but early estimates place the losses in the tens of millions.\\n\\nStock losses assessed after Vic bushfires\\nGovernment inspectors are assessing stock losses after bushfires in eastern Victoria, which have destroyed about 20 houses.\\nHundreds of kilometres of fencing, large areas of pasture and sheds have been destroyed in a number of locations in Gippsland and the north-east ranges, including around Toongabbie, Gaffney\\'s Creek and Cooper\\'s creek.\\nA 48-year-old man died when he fell off a trailer while fighting a fire near Heyfield in Gippsland.\\nThere have been significant stock losses around Dargo, and Angus Hume, from Victoria\\'s Department of Primary Industries, says farmers need to be ready for more fire fronts in coming days.\\n\"You really must make sure that you have water provided for stock and feed if you have them in containment areas and just those general things that are about planning beforehand,\" he said.\\n\\nClimate change to worsen fire situation: report\\nThe farmer-funded Climate Institute says high bushfire danger days will increase by up to a third in the next 30 years, as a result of climate change.\\nThe lobby group has analysed data from the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, which suggests Australia is likely to heat up and become drier.\\nClimate scientist Graham Pearman says governments need to decide whether they invest in measures to mitigate climate change now, or boost firefighting resources later.\\n\\nFarmers under pressure to compete in global trade\\nA new report backs farmer claims that they are under pressure to cut costs to remain competitive in global trade.\\nThe Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) says while food exports have grown at 10 per cent a year, it is getting harder to make a profit in both export and domestic markets.\\nABARE\\'s Lisa Elliston says manufacturers and processors are also under pressure.\\n\\nFarmers turn to Malaysia for cheap fodder\\nDairy processor Murray Goulburn is looking to our northern neighbours for fodder to help farmers feed their cows.\\nThe first shipment of palm kernel extract from Malaysia is due in mid-January.\\nThe extract is a by-product of the palm oil industry, and is made up of ground and dried skins, and the flesh of the palm kernel.\\nRoss Greenaway from Murray Goulburn says the rising price of grain makes the extract a cheaper option for farmers.\\n\"This first load of palm kernel is $220 plus GST plus freight. That is very cost effective compared to the current price of grain,\" he said.\\n\\nDon\\'t ignore depression, doctors urge\\nRural doctors say their already tight resources will be stretched as the drought drags on, but they are urging people to seek help for depression regardless.\\nThe Rural Doctors Association says people feeling stressed and depressed to see their GPs early, because problems can become worse the longer they are untreated.\\nPresident Dr Peter Riesbieth says rural practices will have to prioritise their appointments, but it is important to ask for help.\\n\\nRiverina irrigators call for compensation\\nRiverina irrigators have rallied to voice their anger at New South Wales Government cuts to their water allocations, and are calling for compensation.\\nRice farmers, dairy farmers and croppers, already had zero water allocations this season, but since October the NSW Government has cut 52 per cent of farmer\\'s carry over water.\\nThis is water farmers have saved in the previous year, to use in the current drought.\\nSo today farmers are rallying in the streets, to show their anger at the State Government\\'s decision.\\nFarmers also say a number of towns and 1,500 farming families now could run out of household water and water for stock.\\n\\nGovt expected to change forestry investment rules\\nThe Federal Government is expected to make changes to the investment rules for Managed Investment Schemes (MIS) for plantation forestry.\\nIt is believed the Government will not remove tax advantages for investors, but instead regulate how much invested money is spent on planting trees.\\nLiberal Senator Bill Heffernan says he would not object to the changes because Australia needs more trees for environmental reasons.\\nBut he wants the laws changed for schemes for annual crops, like wine, tomatoes, olives and wheat.\\n\\nInmates trained to become croc farmers\\nInmates from the Darwin Correctional Centre have been trained to become the next generation of Northern Territory crocodile farmers.\\nFarmer Mick Burns helped to develop the croc handling course, which is designed for prisoners from remote communities where problem crocodiles are common.\\nHe says there are huge growth opportunities for farming and harvesting skin, and meat.\\n\\'I think that there is real value in terms of development of the crocodile industry to develop regional satellite farms,\" he said.\\n\"All we can really do is present the opportunity and make sure that we have the infrastructure and the training, and the like, and then it\\'s really up to the communities.\\n\"So whether they are ex-prisoners or they are not, a lot of it is just about creating an opportunity and we are pretty happy to be doing that.\\n\\nWheat export issue divides growers\\nWheat growers across Australia are divided on whether Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran should allow AWB\\'s rivals to export wheat.\\nMr McGauran now holds the wheat export veto and is considering 44 bids to export wheat to 20 countries after calling on traders to submit their applications.\\nFarmers disagree on what Mr McGauran should do, but believe opening the market would be the end of the single desk.\\n\"It\\'s too detrimental for the whole grains industry to allow those to take place, it would effectively destroy the single desk as we know it,\" one farmer said.\\n\"As far as we\\'re concerned as growers, the single desk has run its day.\\n\"To think that you are just going to chuck all that out in one year I think is extremely dangerous, we need to have this debate first and then decide how our wheat is going to be handled.\"\\n\\nFarmers debate single desk\\nMeanwhile Victorian grain growers are debating how they would like their wheat marketed overseas at a major forum in Bendigo today.\\nSitting in a hot carpark under a marquee are just under 400 farmers, who have travelled several hundred kilometres from Swan Hill and Horsham, as well as other grain growing areas to have their say on the single desk.\\nThe Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF), who have organised today\\'s forum, wants to retain the single desk and have it controlled by growers.\\n\\nQld storms crush fruit and cane crops\\nSevere storms which lashed south-east Queensland over the weekend have flattened young sugar cane crops and destroyed fruit in the Childers district, near Bundaberg.\\nStrong winds have brought down trees and power lines, while hail stones described as half the size of cricket balls have damaged crops.\\nCane, mango and lychee grower John Muller was set to harvest fruit in coming weeks, but says his crops have been almost completely wiped out.\\n\"There\\'s probably less than 1 per cent of the mangoes hanging on the tree and every one of them has five or six chops out of them,\" he said.\\n\\nProgram aims to encourage farmers to talk about depression\\nNational organisation Beyondblue is launching a new program today it hopes will encourage farmers and rural communities to talk about depression.\\nThe organisation is launching the first phase of its drought action plan with Incitec Pivot.\\nIncitec staff will be trained to recognise symptoms of depression and point people in the right direction for medical and financial help.\\nIncitec employee and sufferer of depression Noel Trevaskis says most staff are relieved they can offer practical support.\\n\"If they\\'re talking to a farmer or a farmer\\'s wife or whoever, then they will be able to have the skills to be able to recognise those signs and symptoms,\" he said.\\n\"They\\'ll also be able to offer some help and advice as to where people can get help to see them through the problem that they\\'re experiencing.\"\\n\\nFarmers fined over land blockades\\nFor the first time, farmers in the central west of New South Wales have been fined for stopping state authorities from investigating claims of illegal land clearing.\\nFarmers have blockaded two properties at Tottenham at the weekend.\\nThe Department of Natural Resources says it had warned farmer representative that fines would be imposed if access was blocked.\\nOne infringement notice for an $1,100 fine has been served, with another two to be handed out this week.\\nDepartment spokesman Steve Dunn says attempts had been made to work with land holders but the department has a duty to carry out inspections.\\n\\nFarmers assess bushfire damage\\nAs bushfires continue to rage in eastern Victoria, some farmers have had a chance to survey the damage caused by the blaze.\\nStock, sheds and houses have been lost so far and landholders are gearing up to protect their properties again as temperatures rise this week.\\nGippsland farmers Roger and Kate Bond have lost poultry and sheds, although firefighters managed to save their farm house at Cowwarr and some sheep.\\nBoth are wheelchair-bound and Mr Bond says it is going to take a long time to rebuild.\\n\\nCane smut found near Townsville\\nThe crippling fungal disease sugar cane smut has been discovered even further north in Queensland, in the Herbert River region near Townsville.\\nThe disease, which cuts crop yields, had been first found in the Isis and Bundaberg area in June, and more recently in the central region near Mackay.\\nA two kilometre quarantine zone has been imposed around the latest discovery in the Lannacost area.\\nCanegrowers chairman Alf Cristaudo says finding the disease in the wetter northern region had been unexpected but growers are prepared.\\n\"We would ask everyone now to be even more vigilant than they have been, it\\'s disappointing and a surprise that we are finding it anywhere,\" she said.\\n\\nApple and pear plantings drop\\nNew plantings of apple and pear trees have fallen by up to 6 per cent.\\nThe latest Bureau of Statistics figures for 2005-2006 also show apple production is down more than 15 per cent on the previous year.\\n\\nSA Govt accused of mismanaging fish stocks\\nA long-term prawn fisher in South Australia is concerned about stock levels, accusing the State Government of mismanagement.\\nAn official report in SA has found the prawn catch is only one third what it was in the 1970s.\\nCommercial fisher Maurice Corigliano says the Government has allowed overfishing in Gulf St Vincent and wants boat numbers reduced.\\nThe Government has had meetings with the fishermen and told them it is their responsibility to ensure the fishery is managed sustainably.\\nMr Corigliano says the Minister for Fisheries, Rory McEwen, is dodging the issue.\\n\"It\\'s the Government\\'s responsibility to manage that fishery, they have the power to say how many vessels come in, how many vessels go out, when they can fish, where they can fish, what size prawn they can take, what size vessels they can use,\" he said.\\n\"Regrettably, he is simply not doing so and is simply dodging the issue.\"\\nThe Prawn Boat Owners Association disagrees, saying numbers have not depleted and there is no need to reduce licences.\\nCurrently there are only 10 licensed boats.\\n\\nGovt finalises revamped horticulture code\\nThe code of conduct for Australia\\'s horticulture sector has been finalised by the Federal Government.\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says any new agreements and wholesalers signed after December 15 will be subject to the code.\\nIt is expected to be tabled in Parliament in February and will then become law.\\n\\nTas begins dairy cow exports to Pakistan\\nTasmanian farmers are exporting live dairy cows to Pakistan for the first time.\\nAbout 1,000 cows are sent to China from Tasmania each year but that trade has slowed this season.\\nLivestock agent Craig Waldron says the new market looks promising, with Pakistan paying $800 a head for cross-bred heifers.\\n\"Given the season on the current returns of what you can expect to buy replacement stock for, it\\'s pretty reasonable to buy a female that was only just recently joined,\" he said.\\n\\nCampaign spares Guyra horses\\nMore than 100 horses have been granted a reprieve in the Guyra region of New South Wales after a campaign to stop them being sent to the knackery.\\nThe future of the horses had been uncertain after their death and a farmer providing agistment has asked for them to be moved.\\nCampaign coordinator Bianca Lyne says there are plenty of people who want to help.\\n\"People have called from as far away as Tasmania and I\\'m actually getting emails even from overseas,\" she said.\\n\\nEconomists call for independent national water body\\nThere are calls today for an independent, national body to control Australia\\'s water resources.\\nTwo water economists have put together the plan to remove political tensions between state and federal governments.\\nOne of the plan\\'s authors, CSIRO Professor Mike Young, says a more responsive and consistent system is needed to decide water allocations, trading rules and entitlements.\\nProfessor Young says there is widespread concern that the current system is hamstrung by politics.\\n\"People are very frustrated with what\\'s happening, there\\'s a lot of frustration around the rules over water trading and things like exit fees,\" he said.\\n\"Every state is taking subtly different approaches, if you had a structure like this it would all be resolved in a unified way, so there\\'d be no opportunity for arbitrage from one state to another.\"\\nBut there are concerns from irrigators that the proposal would leave agriculture out of the water reform process.\\nNational Farmers Federation irrigation task force spokesman Laurie Arthur says farmers need to be represented.\\n\"I have real concerns that agriculture will not be front and centre of the debate,\" he said.\\n\"I\\'m a little bit concerned at the moment that expertise within agriculture for example, within our irrigation companies, is a bit remote from the decision-making process.\"\\n\\nWorking together\\nMeanwhile, peak farm, water, environment and business organisations have agreed to work together to push for improvements in water security for farmers and urban users.\\nThe National Water Commission (NWC) stakeholder group has agreed on priorities, including better water accounting and reporting, and addressing over-allocation of rivers.\\nCommission chairman Peter Corish says the group realises that bodies outside government can contribute to finding solutions to Australia\\'s water problems.\\n\\nVets urge livestock checks in bushfire regions\\nVets are urging farmers in bushfire-affected districts to check their livestock once fires have passed through.\\nIn Victoria\\'s Central Gippsland area, 530 beef cattle, 62 sheep and goats and 120 chickens have been lost.\\nDepartment of Primary Industries vet Liz Parker says damage from the fires might not show for some days.\\n\"They can look really bad, they can be covered in black and look terrible, but actually they really don\\'t have much damage at all,\" she said.\\n\"Other animals can look fine but the burns can be in the respiratory tract and sometimes the evidence of that doesn\\'t come up for a couple of days as well, and they can be really life-threatening and the animals might need to be put to sleep.\"\\n\\nCommunities struggle this season\\nMeanwhile, it has not been feeling a lot like Christmas in parts of fire-ravaged Victoria, with many communities cancelling festive events due to an increased fire threat this week.\\nBut one country town found the time to host a carols service last night, to give the locals a break from the worries of drought and fire.\\nNova Underwood from Heyfield says it has been a stressful week, with the fire coming within 7 kilometres of her property.\\n\"Christmas has been put on the backburner, but we\\'re trying to encourage the spirit this week,\" she said.\\n\\nDrought spurs calls to renew healthy sheep flocks\\nSheep producers are being urged to take advantage of the drought, to refresh the gene pool of the national flock.\\nResearchers at the Sheep Cooperative Research Centre have developed new technology to help graziers keep their best sheep, based on their breeding potential for wool and meat.\\nStud Merino Breeders Association president Will Roberts says producers are trying hard to hang on to their best animals.\\n\"In a lot of stud flocks and things they\\'re not always age structured, they\\'re quality structured, and it\\'s a little more difficult and people are less reluctant to sell those animals anyway, so they try to hang onto them,\" he said.\\n\\nPork prices climb this Christmas\\nDemand for pork products has improved this Christmas, with prices lifting at retail level.\\nThe industry has been struggling against major competition from imports during the past few years, not helped by a strong Australian dollar.\\nBut New South Wales pork producer Neil Unger says prices of around 300 cents per kilogram are not keeping pace with increased production costs.\\n\"Our cost of production is very, very close to $2.50,\" he said.\\n\"We lose probably 20 cents in dockages because we don\\'t like this one, that one is too skinny, that one is too fat.\\n\\nTurf industry loses out to rising water restrictions\\nTightening water restrictions in many parts of Australia are taking their toll on the turf-laying industry.\\nThe industry has lost $15 million this year, as home owners become reluctant to lay grass they cannot water.\\nTurf Producers Australia spokesman Ray Moir says South Australia has been the hardest state hit by the drought, with its largest business deciding to close its doors after 25 years.\\n\"It\\'s having varying effects from state to state,\" he said.\\n\\nAuthorities arrest 10 Malaysian farm workers\\nTen Malaysian workers have been arrested after allegedly working illegally on farms near Menindee, in western New South Wales.\\nThe group of six men and four women have been sent to Port Augusta in South Australia to face deportation.\\nFederal Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone says they will be transported out of Australia as soon as possible.\\n\\nRecycled water blamed for lettuce damage\\nLettuce growers in Victoria fear their crops are being damaged by recycled effluent water from the Werribee Sewage Farm, near Melbourne.\\nMore than half of Australia\\'s iceberg lettuces are grown at Werribee.\\nThe farmers have been using the recycled water since last year, when the State Government banned the use of underground water due to the drought.\\nSouthern Rural Water spokesman Clinton Rodda says an investigation is under way to find out what has caused stunted growth and discolouration of lettuces.\\n\"Certainly the salinity is higher than ideal and this is an interim scheme until, hopefully, the salt reduction program will move to lower salt in the long-term,\" he said.\\n\"But I think these farmers in Werribee south are very effective in the way they manage their crops, they\\'re aware of the higher salinity.\\nSome of them have dealt with higher salinity bores for many, many years in the past, so they learn how to deal with those high salinity levels.\"\\n\\nGrowers face pressure over wholesaler contracts\\nA Queensland horticulture group says growers have been pressured into signing contracts by wholesalers trying to avoid the industry\\'s new code of conduct.\\nAll contracts signed on or after last Friday are subject to the code, which is designed to improve transparency.\\nGrowcom spokesman Jan Davis says some growers had to sign contracts before Friday, while others were asked to back-date agreements.\\n\\nNZ suspends Aust honey exports\\nPlans to export honey across the Tasman have hit a snag, with the New Zealand High Court suspending the trade until a full biosecurity risk assessment is completed.\\nBiosecurity New Zealand had given the nod to imports, but beekeepers appealed the interim decision, claiming Australian honey contains diseases that could threaten the local industry.\\n\\nAust vegetable imports outweigh export, growers say\\nVegetable growers say Australia is importing far more produce than it exports.\\nMost of the surge has been for frozen and processed vegetables, particularly potatoes.\\nPeak grower body Ausveg says imports have jumped by almost 35 per cent in the last four years, to $375 million.\\nAusveg spokesman Ian James says the trend is concerning, especially when vegetable exports have dropped back because of a loss of markets.\\n\"Some of these frozen vegetables reflect renewed or different sourcing policies of the food processors in Australia, in particular, over the last 12 months anyway, a switch from Australian-sourced product to New Zealand-sourced product,\" he said.\\n\"But there has also been some substantial increases in imports coming from the European Union as well.\"\\n\\nEmergency services failed to tackle fire: report\\nAn investigation into the 2003 Canberra bushfires has highlighted a failure to attack fires early and a failure to warn the public of impending danger.\\nFour people were killed and 500 homes destroyed in the blaze, which started in the mountains, west of Canberra.\\nThe coronial report makes more than 70 recommendations, but there is concern over how the ACT Government will respond.\\nACT coroner Maria Doogan has handed down 15 findings on the cause of the fire.\\nAmong them, the ACT Emergency Services Bureau had failed to aggressively attack the fires.\\nThey withdrew crews on the night they started, fire trails were overgrown, and there were heavy fuel loads.\\nShe also found that in the face of drought and extreme fire conditions, the bureau had inadequate maps, planning, bulldozers and other support for fire crews.\\nThe coroner has acknowledged that the ACT Government had already given more statutory power to emergency services, but had since returned the fire control to answer to bureaucrats with no special emergency management knowledge.\\n\\nScience students needed to combat future climate change\\nA lack of students wanting to study agriculture and science is causing concern.\\nUniversities and scientific bodies say the shortage could hurt Australia\\'s ability to cope with issues like climate change and natural resource management.\\nThe University of Sydney is blaming negative perceptions of the rural economy due to the drought, despite strong demand for graduates.\\nCSIRO spokesman Murray Cameron says a shortage of maths graduates has already delayed some of its research programs.\\n\"A lot of Australia\\'s history in agriculture, for example, has been in our ability to use genetics to breed better animals, better plant species, a lot of that in the future is about using mathematics effectively,\" he said.\\n\\nFortescue gains access to BHP Billiton rail lines\\nThe Federal Court has given Fortescue Metals Group open access to BHP Billiton\\'s iron ore rail lines in Western Australia\\'s Pilbara region.\\nThe decision means BHP Billiton can no longer stop other companies from using the Mount Newman and Goldsworthy rail lines, despite claiming them as part of its own production process.\\nForetescue has successfully argued that the lines were a \\'service\\', under the Trade Practices Act and should be available to all companies who need them.\\nFortescue spokesman Graeme Rowley says the court has upheld a right to fair competition.\\n\"We not only now have achieved success for ourselves, but we\\'ve also achieved success for Australia,\" he said.\\n\"We now go to the Australian Competition Tribunal to ask them to approve effectively our access to that infrastructure.\\n\"That overturns the Treasurer\\'s decision that we could not have that access.\"\\n\\nCattle ID scheme issues being resolved: NLIS chairman\\nThe chairman of the National Livestock Identification Scheme (NLIS) for cattle says problems with the scheme are being addressed.\\nA leaked copy of an audit of the scheme, commissioned by the federal Agriculture Minister, has highlighted problems with farmer cooperation, scrutiny of the system and different levels of state compliance.\\nChairman John Wyld says the NLIS is working well overall, but admits there are weaknesses, including the lack of a back-up plan if Telstra\\'s systems supporting the database go down.\\n\"Our contract with Telstra requires a full disaster recovery plan,\" he said.\\n\"Now I\\'m aware there is an ongoing issue between MLA and Telstra, but it\\'s really a matter that Telstra\\'s not been able to comply with but it\\'s part of our contract.\\n\\nDrought blamed for lucerne crop failure\\nDryland lucerne production in the upper south-east of South Australia has been hit hard by the drought with virtually no hay cut this year.\\nThe area between Tintinara and Naracoorte is generally regarded as one of the nation\\'s biggest lucerne hay-producing regions but has recorded its lowest rainfall totals in a century.\\nCharlie Hilton from Lucerne Australia says if there is no rain in the next three months, it is possible some long-established lucerne stands will be lost.\\n\"If stands have thinned out to be not economic to leave, they are going to have to be re-established,\" he said.\\n\"Once you do that, you virtually lose production off those dryland paddocks for a year.\\n\\nTurf grass producer bites the dust\\nTightening water restrictions in many parts of Australia are taking their toll on the turf-laying industry.\\nThe industry has lost $15 million this year, as home owners become reluctant to lay grass they cannot water.\\nRay Moir from Turf Producers Australia says South Australia has been hardest hit by the drought.\\n\"It\\'s having varying effects from state to state,\" he said.\\n\\nDarling River weirs may prolong water period\\nTwo temporary weirs have been built on the lower portion of the Darling River in far western New South Wales to shore up water supplies.\\nThe weirs, about 50 kilometres north of Wentworth, are built from compacted clay banks containing large pipes and regulators.\\nAlan Whyte from Jamesville Station says it will not drought-proof the Darling, but it will give landholders a more reliable water supply.\\n\"We know the river is going to cease to flow within two or three months\\' time,\" he said.\\n\"There was an opportunity to put some banks in to hold up a bit of water particularly for a few people who are below the existing Tulney Weir.\\n\\nCanberra bushfires report damning\\nLandholders west of Canberra who warned authorities about the impending fire danger in early 2003 say they have been vindicated by an investigation into the subsequent bushfires.\\nThe ACT coroner has released a damning report on poor preparation and fire management for the blaze, which killed four people and injured 400 others.\\nOne of the report\\'s major recommendations is that the Emergency Services Agency be reinstated as an independent body that is not answerable to bureaucrats.\\nVal Jeffery, a long-term firefighter who is credited with saving his village of Tharwa, says someone should be held responsible for the disaster.\\n\"There\\'s a stark lesson here for the rest of Australia,\" he said.\\n\\nCommunity \\'weary\\' from bushfires\\nWith temperatures set to rise in Victoria in coming days, landholders in the state\\'s east are once again gearing up to fight fires that are threatening private property.\\nThe fires have been burning for almost two weeks, destroying more than 700 hectares.\\nGippsland farmer Julie Duffy says many landholders, families and volunteers are becoming exhausted by the ongoing blaze.\\n\"The whole community is weary,\" she said.\\n\"The CFA has worked tirelessly.\\n\\nFuel thefts causing concern\\nAviation fuel is being stolen from some remote Top End airports and there is concern the thefts could pose a major safety risk.\\nCharity charter company Mission Aviation Fellowship says up to 60-litre batches of fuel are being taken from aircrafts in the small communities of Milingimbi and Raminging in Arnhem Land.\\nGeneral manager Ian McBride says people are stealing the $2 per litre fuel on a fortnightly basis to use in their own vehicles.\\n\"Our main concern really, over and above the loss of the fuel, is the safety aspect,\" he said.\\n\"Where aircraft get tampered with and fuel caps get left off and possibly fuel tanks contaminated.\\n\\nCWA distributes Xmas cheer to drought-stricken families\\nThe Country Women\\'s Association (CWA) has distributed some Christmas cheer to 680 families and 40 communities in drought-stricken New South Wales.\\nThe state branch of the CWA has been allocating emergency funds as part of a Federal Government aid program in October.\\nUp to $2,000 has been available to families to meet food and utility costs, while grants of $3,000 have helped towns to hold community events.\\nVice president Colleen Wills says the money has gone where it is needed most.\\n\"To keep the phones going, car, for petrol, to get to town to do the shopping, to doctors - it\\'s all the basics,\" she said.\\n\\n\\'Santa\\' drops in on remote stations\\nPlanes flying to remote stations are being loaded with hundreds of kilograms of presents in the lead-up to Christmas.\\nAlice Springs-based Chart Air has flown to up to 60 properties across the Northern Territory this week to deliver mail.\\nPilot John Zonaras says he has been re-named Santa because half his mailbags contain gifts.\\n\"The mail and that sort of stuff has definitely increased in volume,\" he said.\\n\"Like today I had a mail run with 42 mailbags and about 350 kilograms so probably a good 150 kilograms of it was presents.\\n\\nAWB payments to Saddam regime not bribes: ATO\\nThere has been a strong surge in AWB\\'s share price today after the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) cleared the company of any wrongdoing in an investigation of payments made under the oil-for-food program.\\nFindings from the Cole inquiry said AWB wrote off payments under the oil-for-food program as tax deductions, including those to trucking company Alia.\\nIt had been thought the company may have been liable for up to $450 million in penalties and unpaid tax.\\nBut in a statement to the stock exchange, AWB says the tax office has found the payments did not constitute bribes to foreign public officials under the Income Tax Assessment Act.\\nThe stock market has reacted favourably, with AWB shares gaining more than 7 per cent this morning, trading at $2.81 shortly before 10:00am AEDT.\\nMeanwhile AWB\\'s rivals are being asked for details on their prices, returns to growers and the effect their applications might have on the national pool.\\nThe conditions are set out in a letter from the Department of Agriculture sent this week to all the companies that want to export wheat.\\nThe letter says the Government wants more information as it tries to establish the \\'public interest\\' value of each application.\\nExporter Peter Howard from Ozepulse says some of conditions are surprising.\\n\"I think it\\'s unusual - we\\'ve always thought and argued in the past that any applications approved wouldn\\'t really have any effect to the detriment of the pool,\" he said.\\n\"But I guess it\\'s a point in question looking at what the cost might be to those pool participants, would they increase if these applications are granted.\\n\"Perhaps they would, but our answer is that surely AWB should be reducing those fees to those pool participants.\"\\n\\nNSW, WA support single desk\\nIn another development, New South Wales grain growers have stepped up the battle to save the single desk wheat export system at a rally in the Riverina.\\nFarmers in southern New South Wales have precious little wheat to sell this year, but about 350 were in Narrandera to show their support for the single desk.\\nLocal farmer Hugh Hart says it maximises returns to growers in a corrupt world market.\\n\"Give the power of veto back to the company,\" he said.\\n\"Let them get on with the job and let\\'s all look forward, so when it starts to rain we can make a quid again and cut all this rubbish out.\\n\"We\\'ve had enough - no more inquiries, no more consultation, just get on with the job.\"\\nNationals MP Kay Hull says farmers need to voice their support for the single desk to silence a noisy minority in the Federal Government.\\nNational Party Senators Ron Boswell and Barnaby Joyce are expected to address the crowd.\\nIn Western Australia, 200 growers have also backed the single desk at a public meeting in the Wheatbelt town of Mingenew.\\nFarmer Peter Hord says the meeting will probably come to nothing.\\n\"It seems to be typical of all of the meetings that have taken place,\" he said.\\nUS TAKES ACTION AGAINST AWB\\nUS Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns has temporarily banned wheat exporter AWB from using his department\\'s programs, in the wake of the Cole Inquiry.\\nJohanns acted following his directive last month that USDA resume debarment proceedings against AWB.\\nHe says he\\'s suspended AWB, several individuals and a Minnesota commodities firm from USDA programs or purchases.\\n\"The extent of our ability to act here is debarment.\\n\"Now, Congress may look at this and say there\\'s a need for a legislative approach. They certainly have a right to do that.\\nThe suspension does not prevent Australian wheat from being sold in the US or affect AWB\\'s ability to trade on commodity exchanges.\\nAWB spokesman Peter McBride says the programs have only ever been a small part of the business.\\nThey include US government subsidies and loan guarantees for selling US crops overseas.\\nHe says the company voluntarily withdrew from the programs, when the UN inquiry into the Oil for Food program began.\\n\"We have not used this export subsidy program since early 2004 and we informed the USDA earlier this year that we would voluntarily stand aside from using the program in the foreseeable future.\\n\"So we\\'ll continue discussions with the USDA going forward, but we haven\\'t used the program in a long time and we didn\\'t envisage using itÂ\".\\nAWB\\'s shares continue to trade strongly after yesterday\\'s clearance by the Australian Tax Office.\\nThe ATO has accepted that payments made under the Oil-for-Food program did not constitute bribes to foreign public officials, under the Income Tax Assessment Act.\\nAustock analyst Paul Jensz says the ruling is worth around 50 cents to the share price.\\n\"It\\'s one of the first bits of positive news to come out of what has been a fairly devastating year.\\n\"This does help the momentum inside the company and the renewal and the change that they\\'re doing on a cultural level and a cost levelÂ\".\\n\\nNot enough full-time doctors\\nWhile rural Australia continues to cry out for doctors, there\\'s now alarm over the falling number of doctors willing to work full time.\\nThe Australian Institute of Health and Welfare says the number of full-time GPs fell more than 30 per cent between 2000 and 2004.\\nIt says some country residents are now waiting up to three weeks for an appointment.\\nDr Peter Rischbieth, from the Rural Doctors Association, says the holiday season will put extra pressure on rural communities.\\n\"There are some towns that have massive influxes of population through the tourist and holiday season, and some of these towns do struggle to provide appointments for both their residents and the tourists who are arriving, as well as some doctors understandably wanting to have leave during this time with their familiesÂ\"\\n\\nWool growers advised to keep sheep\\nWith the best demand conditions for wool in five years analysts are urging farmers to hang onto their sheep, with strong prices expected to continue into 2007.\\nAlthough the costs of hand feeding are proving difficult to meet for many wool producers, some analysts think prices could reach ten year highs in the New Year.\\nChief economist at Woolmark Chris Wilcox says the lower forecast in production is also keeping demand strong.\\n\"The questions that I was being asked in China revolved largely about supply concerns.\\n\"That, I think, will without doubt help support demand, certainly in the first quarter of 2007. It is worth persisting particularly into the first quarter and maybe a bit beyondÂ\".\\n\\nBanks back victorian farmers\\nIt\\'s been a pretty grim season for grain growers in Western Victoria, but the major banks are confident that there is still a future for farming in the region.\\nSenior staff from seven leading banks have attended forums this week to reassure farmers that they aren\\'t planning to foreclose on properties.\\nBill Dean from the NAB says banks have worked hard over the past decade to improve their relationships with farmers.\\n\"I think the most important thing for farming customers is to keep the lines of communication open, to sit down with their bankers, explore the options and work out where they are going to go. \\n\"In the majority of cases, we\\'re seeing customers that, whilst they are concerned about what has happened in the last 12 months, they are very confident about the long term future, as the bank isÂ\".\\n\\nConfidence about gm wheat trials\\nVictoria\\'s first crop of genetically modified wheat could be in the ground as early as next year, despite a state moratorium on commercial crops of GM canola.\\nThe Government has applied for a permit and hopes to have trials of the drought resistant wheat approved by June next year.\\nDr Bruce Kefford from the Department of Primary Industries is confident of the trial\\'s success.\\n\"This is work we have done in collaboration with the CRC for Molecular Plant Breeding, some colleagues in South Australia, and other parties.\\n\"There are actually a number of lines which have a number of potential treatments for drought resistance in them and we\\'ve got about thirty lines that will be trialled in quite small trials if it\\'s approvedÂ\".\\n\\nDAIRY FARMERS FEAR FEED PRICE RISES\\nThe dairy industry is worried that a high level of wheat exports could affect local feed grain prices.\\nThe Federal Government is expected to announce tomorrow, whether it will allow companies other than AWB to ship wheat overseas.\\nHead of Australian Dairy Farmers John McQueen says any further increases in grain prices would hurt the industry.\\n\"As far as domestic prices go, it should make no impact whatsoever, and we would be very disappointed if exports did anything to domestic prices.\\n\"Domestic prices should not at any time go above import parity and our preference would be lower than import parity.\\n\"Export licences should not give a green light to anybody increasing domestic prices for grainÂ\".\\n\\nLOCAL FISH COSTLY FOR CHRISTMAS\\nThe Sydney Fish Markets are preparing for the Christmas rush, with 80,000 customers expected through the doors this weekend.\\nBut they\\'ll be faced with an expensive decision about whether to pay higher prices for local produce, or buy cheaper frozen imports.\\nThe price contrast is expected to be even greater this Christmas, with the markets\\' biggest supplier facing its worst year in four decades.\\nRussell Creighton from the Clarence River Fisherman\\'s Co-operative says drought has claimed another casualty.\\n\"The seafood catch has probably been one of the lowest I\\'ve experienced and I\\'ve been here for forty years.\\n\"And the contributing factor playing a big part is the drought, because there\\'s no nutrient running into the river, and the rivers are the nursery for both inshore and offshore species of prawns and crustaceans. So we\\'re really feeling the pinch this ChristmasÂ\".\\n\\nBEE INDUSTRY BUZZING\\nBeekeepers in eastern Australia are having mixed fortunes.\\nThe eucalypts are bursting with flowers and nectar in southern New South Wales, but low world prices, bushfires and drought are hurting.\\nSeventy per cent of Australian honey comes from eucalypts, and right now the gums in the Southern Tablelands are full of flowers.\\nDoug Sommerville with the NSW Department of Primary Industries says it\\'s in response to a break after the last drought and the intensity of this one: \"The fellas are making good honey right now, off snow gum, yellow box, red gum, all in the nice quality honey\".\\nBut he says disaster is imminent with the drought continuing and beekeeper Greg Roberts says the fires of 2001 and now are devastating.\\n\"It takes many, many years for species such as stringybark to come back after fire.\"\\nWith low world honey prices, Australian beekeepers are switching from exporting honey to exporting live bees to the US, under the free trade agreement.\\n\\nREMOTE BUT EFFECTIVE\\nA new survey suggests that landholders in isolated areas should be using remote monitoring technology to save more time and money.\\nThe Kondinin farm research group travelled Australia looking into technology, such as virtual fencing, walkover weighing and remote controlled helicopter mustering.\\nAnd Research and Development Manager Ben White says they found remote water monitoring had the most potential to improve efficiency on properties.\\nThe report, funded by Meat and Livestock Australia, will be released in February.\\nKIWI WOMEN CHIP IN TO HELP IN BUSHFIRE BATTLE\\nNew Zealand farming women are offering help to Australian families affected by the bushfires.\\nRural Women New Zealand is trying to find out what help is needed, so members can raise money, or send food parcels.\\nPresident Sherryl Dackers says the group has been in email contact with similar women\\'s networks in Victoria.\\n\"From Australia we\\'ve had the suggestion that we may be able to support some women who probably after this disaster won\\'t be able to afford to go to a conference which is being held in Australia, and also with food parcels.\\n\"What we as rural women New Zealand would like know is what your rural people would need in way of assistanceÂ\".\\n\\nAT ONE WITH TUNA IN BRINE\\nForget swimming with the dolphins. Tourists can now swim with the most valuable fish in the sea - tuna.\\nIn South Australia, a Port Lincoln charter company will allow people to swim in a sea farm with about 100 tuna fish, worth up to $5,000 each.\\nMatt Waller, from Calypso Star Charters, reckons there\\'ll be plenty of interest.\\n\"I\\'ve seen them sit behind a boat at 10 to 12 knots, sort of 15 to 20 kilometres an hour for up to half an hour. I\\'ve seen quick reflex speeds of probably 40 to 50 kilometres an hour.\\n\"They travel all around Australia, around the world, and they return to the same places year after year.\\n\\nAWB payments

sellers, as well as seafood and poultry stall owners, seem to be a bit reluctant to eat their own produce this Christmas.\\nHere are some views from Melbourne\\'s Queen Victoria Market.\\n\"We\\'ve already \\'mangoed\\' out, the kids don\\'t want any more,\" one stallholder said.\\n\"I don\\'t really go for the turkey at Christmas lunch, I generally go for more ... lamb or beef or something,\" another said.\\n\\nPoor harvest disappoints NT grape growers\\nThere is financial pressure on Northern Territory table grape growers after another disappointing harvest in the major production area.\\nNematodes and termites have meant that most of the vines in the Ti-Tree region have had to be replanted in recent years.\\nThe president of the Northern Territory Grape Producers Association, Greg Kahl, says producers expected higher yields from the young vines in the next few years.\\n\"We\\'ve been battling on for a number of years, our production still hasn\\'t got back to the levels, 2000/2001 harvest,\" he said.\\n\"Basically on expectations across the board [we\\'re] about 60 per cent down.\\n\\nNew owner for Cowra abattoir\\nAn abattoir in central western New South Wales, at the centre of a row over the Federal Government\\'s workplace reforms, has a new owner.\\nThe previous owner of the Cowra abattoir sacked 28 staff under the WorkChoices legislation and then offered to reinstate them at a lower rate.\\nThe plant was handed over to adminstrators in August this year and then closed.\\nNew owner Chris Cummins says major changes will have to be made to make the abattoir viable.\\n\"Obviously we will have a reduction in staff,\" he said.\\n\"The place failed before because it was over-manned.\\n\"For a start there will be working an eight hour day, which wasn\\'t the case before.\\n\"All the chains will be wound back.\\n\"We will have a pretty good product coming out of there, probably as good a product as anywhere on New South Wales will come out of there.\\n\"It\\'s a good plant and needs a little bit of money spending on it, it is in a great position.\\n\\nKing Island to sign Kyoto protocol\\nTasmania\\'s King Island is planning to sign the Kyoto protocol and formally commit to reducing its greenhouse emissions.\\nWhile the island is well-known for its clean and green produce, residents believe that signing the agreement would further boost its reputation.\\nMayor Charles Arnold says he hopes the move will also send a clear message to the Federal Government, which is refusing to ratify the protocol.\\n\"Our politicians think by their hip pocket and if they see that the people in the community want to stand up and be heard, I think that\\'s what should happen,\" he said.\\n\\nUS considers farm spending cuts\\nThe US administration is openly discussing the need to cut US farm spending, even before a possible resumption of world trade talks.\\nUS Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns told a reporter recently that the US farm support system may be sitting in quick sand, under challenge abroad in the WTO (World Trade Organisation) and under fire at home with a budget strained by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\n\"We\\'re doing all we can to get the federal budget under control,\" he said.\\n\"The leadership now of the House and the Senate have talked very, very publicly about this notion that you have to pay for things as you go.\\n\"Those are strong messages that the budget is going to have an impact on policy.\"\\n\\nWoolworths CEO details drought relief strategy\\nSustainable agriculture, drought relief and climate change are the three issues dominating the agenda for the new boss of Woolworths.\\nChief executive Michael Luscombe says the supermarket chain has plans to create \\'green supermarkets\\', improve the company\\'s waste management and reward producers whose farms are environmentally friendly.\\nMr Luscombe says in the short-term, the company is working with the Country Women\\'s Association on a special drought relief project.\\n\"We have decided that we\\'re going to have a national drought relief action day on the 23rd of January,\" he said.\\n\"And on that particular day in 760 supermarkets we\\'re going to donate the profit from that entire day\\'s sales to drought relief.\"\\n\\nEarly Christmas gift for central NSW farmer\\nChristmas has arrived early for at least one lucky farmer in central New South Wales.\\nWith water supplies so critically low, many landholders will not be spending the festive season with families who live far away because they cannot risk leaving the farm for even a day in case stock run out of feed and water.\\nBut Paul Stewart from Mudgee was lucky enough to be under an isolated thunderstorm yesterday that has revitalised his Christmas spirits.\\n\"Almost every dam was empty and almost every dam is full to overflowing,\" he said.\\n\"It was beautiful to watch because we had absolutely no chance of getting away at all with worrying about troughs and pumping water from here to the stock, but we won\\'t have to worry about that now.\"\\nThe weather bureau is forecasting possible isolated showers and storms late today and tomorrow over most of New South Wales.\\nA rain band is moving in from the south-west and rain is forecast this weekend right across the state.\\n\\nThunderstorms bring welcome rain to Eyre Peninsula\\nThere has been a wide range of rainfall totals recorded in South Australia, as a result of large thunderstorms which crossed the state overnight.\\nWhile the rain barely settled the dust in some areas, dams were filled on the eastern Eyre Peninsula and through the state\\'s mid-north.\\nJan Girdham, who farms between Kimba and Cleve, had one of the highest totals with 52 millimetres.\\n\\nMIS plantation forestry tax incentives to stay\\nThe Federal Government has decided not to remove tax advantages for investors in plantation forestry under managed investment schemes (MIS).\\nBut under new changes it will change the law, to ensure that at least 70 per cent of investor\\'s money is spent on trees, instead of other projects.\\nFarmers believe the scheme creates unfair competition for land and water, but assistant treasurer Peter Dutton says the farm sector also receives help.\\n\"The Government has put in place a deliberate strategy to make sure that we support the forestry industry,\" he said.\\n\"At the same time we have provided many other tax incentives and support through the tax system and government policies and otherwise for traditional farming measures such as the Farm Management Deposit Account so it\\'s about providing a balance.\"\\nThe Government has also launched a three-month review of the taxation of non-forestry MIS for crops such as grapes and tomatoes.\\nBut there is criticism from the investment and the farm sector over the continuation of the timber tax deductions.\\nFormer rural banker and agricultural business consultant David Cornish says the Government has done nothing to address community concerns over the impact of plantations.\\nHe says traditional farm enterprises are being overlooked.\\n\"These are just massive tax distortions or subsidies which are leading to distortion of capital into rural Australia,\" he said.\\n\\nGovt to buy back more scallop fishing licences\\nThe Federal Government will buy back another 150 fishing licences as part of its program to reduce over-fishing in Australian waters.\\nThe new scheme includes one third of the scallop fishers in the northern prawn fisheries and 14 per cent of Bass Strait scallop fishers.\\nTheir earlier applications for buyouts were not considered good value by the Government.\\n\\nMcGauran approves non-AWB wheat export contracts\\nFederal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has approved two wheat export contracts for companies other than AWB.\\nOne of the contracts is for 300,000 tonnes for Wheat Australia to ship wheat to Iraq, where AWB has been banned from trading and one for Western Australian-based CBH of 500,000 tonnes to Indonesia.\\nMr McGauran says of the 46 applications received they were the only two considered to be in the public interest.\\nHe says AWB has given assurances the two applications will not have an impact on national pool returns.\\nAs a condition of the export permits, both Wheat Australia and CBH must contribute $4 a tonne to the national pool up to a total of 800,000 tonnes.\\nMeanwhile, the head of AWB International has warned the Federal Government he will have no other choice than to wind up the company, if its veto over wheat exports is removed permanently.\\nAWB International chairman Ian Donges says the Government must be careful in what it decides.\\n\"I think a lot of commentary has been around,\" he said.\\n\"We can have the the bulk veto powers with someone else and have a permit system along side a single desk system.\\n\"Quite clearly you can\\'t do that.\\n\"If the single desk closes down or in fact changes to the point where we don\\'t have a future for the say [in] the 2007 pool then we will phase out of business.\\n\\nEarly grain harvest sees farmers enjoy pre-Christmas activities\\nVictorian grain farmers are being roped into Christmas preparations by their families, with harvest finishing early.\\nUsually most croppers are stripping paddocks right up to and after Christmas day, but the drought has had a drastic impact on yields.\\nGrain growers say the extra time this year is a mixed blessing.\\n\"I actually didn\\'t sow a crop this year, so maybe I\\'ll have an early Christmas, a nice early Christmas,\" one grower said.\\n\"Had a bit more Christmas shopping time, so it\\'s good to get that done instead of at the last minute,\" another said.\\n'"
